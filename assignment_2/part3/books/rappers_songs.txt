You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
'ndale 'ndale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

But I still drove 30 hours
I still drove 30 hours to you

I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with their clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
'Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

And I drove back 30 hours

Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh

3 Stacks, can you help me out?
30 hours


Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola, then I'm coming over
'Cause it's never over

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola, and I keep coming over
'Cause its never over

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

Just wanted to, um  (baby)
Let me, how would I put this, um (baby, baby, baby)
Let's say all your friends (baby, baby, baby)
Remember the one? (baby, baby, baby)
You said if you ever she would be the one (baby, baby, baby)
Ok, ok, ok (you make me smile with my heart)
Well, I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just
Uh, not credibly
I feel that incredibly
I mean let's set it baby
Ah, just let it be
I mean you huntin' me(You make me smile with my heart)

People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezy's off of eBay

Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch

(Hands up, hands up)

I took a deep sweet breath, and I reached into my head
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down


Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom

Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle

Fuck it up, fuck it up

If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that taking Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ay, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome, me, you and the blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove I can focus on two things at once

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ay, none of us would be here without cum
Ay, if it ain't all about the income
Ay, let me see you gon' ahead and spend some
Ay, if you driving round in some Dri-Fit
Ay, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, If I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ay, ay, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

Roll call in the club
Life's a bitch feel her up
She be in my mind like a microchip
I'm ready to blow like nitroglis
Gone gone like a light so trick
I am on some psycho shit
Dance floor every night my bliss
Fed up with the rub don't bite your lip
Bon T.R.S. and pure gold
Max this out in Euros
Bartender fill it up 'til I can't remember
Feeling hot summer nights in the winter
I'mma better my life till we all sit up
Since we are here we are live
Ye and I make you touch the sky

Lalalalalala, lalalalalala

Et puis seulement quand c'est fini
Alors on danse
(Throw your hands in the sky right now)

(It's goin' down)


It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening

I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah

I'm a problem
That'll never
Ever be solved

And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'

Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

I'm amazin'
Yeah I'm all that
If i ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?

Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive for victory
Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!
I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon
That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms
They like oh god!
why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

Ahem' 
Here's something I did 
Somethin I can explain out uh 
I can't speak for everybody, but uh 
Man 

It must be more good women than men percentage-wise 
So her chance of havin a husband just minimized 
That's why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys 
And mess with other girls part time to improvise 
I knew she wouldn't vibe, though I seen it in her eyes 
And I'm like any other guy tryin to get in her thighs 
She telling me bout how black people should enterprise 
And I'm like, 'If you don't get in this ride from Enterprise 
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by five 
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive' 
Told her I had a girl dog, fuck it I didn't lie 
Told her 'This rap game is arite, I'm just getting by' 
She had a little weed and we get a little high 
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm lovin her vibe 
Told me back in '95 she fell in love with the tribe 
Beau, back in '92 I was just like you 
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels 
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool 
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school 
And think, 'Ya, Free's bangin but she's no Rachel' 

We ball til we fall 
Hit the mall 
After we 
Hit don't call 
Fill your lives 
With nothing but lies 
And I would like to apologize 

But you cant stand right here and tell me 
Everything is gonna be alright 
Cuz until the day the real man stands up 
I'm gonna have to improvise 


Was it something I did wrong? Ya I know I'm wrong 
She's at home alone, and I'm always gone 
Hate her when she's mad but more when she's passive 
Now she on the internet looking for classes 
Outta state though, man that hurt yo 
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo 
And she don't call a lot 
And when she do she pourin out her heart 
'You never listen to me' then the call drop 
mmmmmmm 
And I promised her everything 
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring 
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring 
Fightin my urges, strip club splurges 
Never had money so I felt like a virgin 
And I'm tryin to break the bank's cherry 
Tryin to see can I afford canaries, with a Ferarri 
And a dinner date with Halle Berry 
Went from fifty G's to fifteen hundred in a week 
Now I'm tryin to call 
One ring, two rings, seven rings, eight rings 
Her mother picked up the phone 
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more 
I guess its more good women than men percentage-wise 
So her chance of havin a husband just minimized 
I guess that's why she say she aint into guys 
Focus on school full time to improvise 


We ball til we fall 
Hit the mall 
After we 
Hit don't call 
Fill your lives 
With nothing but lies 
And I would like to apologize 

No no, you cant stand right here and tell me 
Everything is gonna be alright 
Cuz until that real man stands up 
I'm gonna have to improvise  




Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone
When I heard the news

When you decide to break the rules
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

People will talk
Like its old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you
How long have you known too
You played it off and act like he's brand new

When you decide to break the rules
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

Oh you just gonna
Keep another no you wont

Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew

Oh you just gonna
Keep another love for you

Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew

While I'm waiting on a dream
That'll never come true

Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew

My face turned to stone
When I heard the news

Whats on the news
Channel cruise


It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

We outta here baby!

"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konichiwa," bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me

Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby

And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch

We outta here baby!

Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(featuring Common) 

(Hook)
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the Kwam uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black car
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express

(Hook)

La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me

Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauren Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now you just prayin

(Hook)

[Common]
You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggaz see the light got fat girls eating right

Ha ha we in this bitch
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggaz know what time it is
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up?
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff
Foreal(Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way
that's why I had to rap on this Cuz
His tracks is Better Than Yours
My tracks is Better Than Yours
Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours
You can have one but we all gonna

Stadium status
Uh

My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin

Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib

Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother

Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate espa'ol
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Don't kill this shit


Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of those bad nights, ya'll have a bad fight
And you talking 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say "Motherfucker, yo momma's a bitch!"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all that attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you!
But I'mma be the bigger man, Big Pimpin' like Jiggaman
Oh I guess I figure it's

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this
Hennessy
It's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having our child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time I would try, you would question me
Saying "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me?
You don't see how ya lies is affecting me
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you'll always be where them hoes'll be"
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time


For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment

But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)

Who's fault

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure
As a last resort, and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about 2 A.M. and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody help

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other, nigga's is stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Rubbing my name threw the mud
Who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
You probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing

(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy

(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well


I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

Feels like I'm bl'

How could it me, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract is on but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dogs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha
I'm the best now,
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,

I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

Ugh, yea, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that
Is the greatest throwback
Since that Nolan Ryan and the days
Been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter,
Baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah
Or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses,
That's my chariot of fire?
Where we flying,
They can't find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it ugh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'm a grab your waist then,
I'm a grab your face and
Then I'm a taste it,
Then I'm a blaze it
Hello all my bad girls,
This just in
Yeezy hurt the beat
Like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in
And he just did it again,
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying
Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per' uh
Prada colored babes
It obvi' we the ish
And I'm rolling with my bricks
So real you so trill baby everything legit
How you feel, they say we crazed
Cause our styles so diff'
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib
Add this, we blazin'
Nicki what you think,
I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
Instead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happening

You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my

To all my second string bitches, tryna get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonc', you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony, uh, yeah yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'Til death but do your part, uh, unholy matrimony


Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, bound

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)


(Brand New) x5

I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "Heat" it up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
I make history e'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

Yo wait - I don't want it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match and make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen - squeezin' into a six
Damn - what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a brand new man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo - this the brand new jam to dance to
While you givin' me "Head" like shampoo - come as you came
Skip the brand name - I won't brand you
What you do here'll stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some more shit and make it new for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg - we can kick it for free you see..

I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick nigga

??? bustin' and then hit 'em - fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggaz constructive criticism
Like "Wait - you basically suck" - his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like "Ma'am - I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him - but if he step I got to diss him
I listen to that weak shit - all of it - I can't follow it
[Barf) Excuse me - I'm "whack"tose intolerant
"I worked too hard to get my baby ballin' kid!"
Down the fives - had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club - and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up - as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around!

I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

Kanye I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick homey


Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to apologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)

First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin', 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is

I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D... a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale thats usin' a toothpick

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $3.99
Later on I might charge for m'nage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss

But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't goin' cost me because she my caddy
'Cause she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug

She asked "Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan

While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexus's one on both hand
So I guess them GS's was ambidextrous

Could of sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"

So say my name like Candyman
And I'm a come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

Can you say Chi city


I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say, she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo ingl's"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Y'all don't from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

Why you come here
I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found
See I'm often at your cross ways
Forgetting it was that Heaven let ya
They'd tried to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd tried to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what'd I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed them
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Then say something where you gon' end up apolog'in
Let me know if it's a problem then
A'ight man, holla then

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash, let that man get past
You don't need to stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes
'Cause how he move in a room full of No's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Ya'll homies lookin' like "why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before"
Stop that
What, you want some patron?
I got that
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all

Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some cris and some mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow

Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!

(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)

When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)

Spend a lot of time in Hampt-I-ons, do a lot of beats you can't be on
Damn all these fans can't be wrong, damn B.I.G. you can't be gone
Make those beats thugs want to rock, make a nigga feal just like 'Pac
Make it street but it just might pop, make it straight to the mountain top
Had the Chi' on lock, when they finally heard our sound with Roc
Came in the game, changed it again, changed everything, yeah
If you feelin this here, throw your fuckin hands in the air

We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting, to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 
Cause we are the champions, of the world

No we the illest niggas realest, I will kill these niggas!

And you wonder why I'm proud of my family?
And you wonder why I ain't gotta rap?

Really shut you the fuck down!! Don't get your career ended
Leave us the fuck alone, let us roc!
We are Roc-Heusen, we're the R., O., C. holla!

I'm here Dame, I'm here, Killa
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes everyday a frisk was at stake
Chicks cuffs risk gettin raped my mission was straight thug
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped a bird outta flip a bird switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar, and Magic
Oh my god it's Magic, Isiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket
Feel Scotty and Mike, feel Shaq and Kobe
My gats will de-tatch you homie
And I'm friends with thugs, I sell endless drugs
For the Roc Fam dog I extend my love
Jay, Bleek, beef I'll be crossin the bridge
Tossin they wigs make corpse of they kids
Free, O, Sparks and Mack Mittens
I'm 95 south, no doubt, mac clip in
I stack chips and, I'm Sacs Fifth-in
Louis Vuitton loughers, hat drippin
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me
Shit, it had three felons, gun shooters no
50 cal. A.C.P. Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid though, I get scrilla man
I'm for'rilla man, yeah it's killa Cam
Uh dick suck bitch!

We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting, to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions, of the world

What y'all thought I was finished?
I'm not! I just recuited somebody new!
I'm like the George Steinbrenner of this shit
I mean I'm rich like him, HOLLA!

Everybody's swarmin' oh my god
It's the newest power forward of the squad
A legacy like Jordan with the mob
That be known for breakin' motherfuckers hard
Put Roc-A-Fella on my pinky ring
Fuck a battle nigga I'm a get them thangs
Rollin with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gone make em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy who's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm fin' to be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Takin it to some motherfuckers domes
Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Fillin my body with lead, clutchin' chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provokin' when I'm smokin' sess
And we gettin' stronger hope you got a vest
Already got them macs, already got them techs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls
Legendary we on top of the world
How could you haters think we can be done
Hold it down because we got champions!!

We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting, to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions, of the world

Dame dash, presents the dream team, part one!

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that 'You the star at the top of my Christmas tree'
My only question is, 'Where my presents?'
She said, 'Shhh,' she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said 'It's Dee-ricious'

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem

Before my exit, it get diamond rolex reckless
Big bags, Got everything on the checklist

Pockets fat, they Precious
Give Ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious
Lighting up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porsche
We on two fifth shopping, what the damage cost
I got your fam while you bidding in the can up north
Woops, I'm at Niemens I hope they still got em
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast cause Christ is born
We gon' party all night til the lights come on

Feels like we bought it all

[Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, mom and dad I won't be home for the holidays
I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York I'm still repping for the A
Cyhi!

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone shovelling the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like its down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You dont wanna miss a moment
Where's your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up!

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem

Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
Lenox Ave to Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just niggas selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
Thats where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah
(My lawyers)

[Verse 8: Teyana Taylor 
&
Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit' your family's where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hoo-hood

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus


[Rakim]
Is y'all ready for Twenty-0-7, it's now another drought 
Everyone's a killer, wow we buggin out 
Since 86 showin the crowd what I'm about 
And they still want to know when the album comin' out 
Ask the teenagers, O'Gs and Ask the kids 
What they definition of Classic is 
Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth 
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters 
Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders 
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas 
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches 
Nas, made you look, before the haters 
I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus 
This is classic 

[Chorus]
classic, better than I'v ever been
talent, 
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been

[Kanye West:]
Can't buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
It's performin', look how long the line is 
That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless 
That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed til' you listened to my pace 
Cuz I be killin' shit, but that's evident, and y'all feelin' it, but I expected it 
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 


[Chorus]

[Nas:] 
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this 
O you went platinum ' yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice 
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time 
It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man 
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, by the time you could afford it the car ain't important 
In the streets silent, it's just I and - cops keep firin' in my environment 
Leavin' your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to 

[Chorus]

[KRS One:] 
How many y'all got criminal minded you you you y'all don't be blinded 
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ' I don't need 'em I got your respect 
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ' this hip hop 
And we's a nation, don't you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin' trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's 
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC'ing and rap 
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people 
Peace, love, unity, and Havin' fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One


What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from, but if you got money, fuck it, cause I want some

B.I.G. fuckin' with me, oh god, whoa

OK ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, She trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rolling with, fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrr!
I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne but I'm the fucking villain,
Man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see (Ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique)

Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

Yeah, I'm talking 'Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih'
Yeah, I'm talking B', nigga, I'm talking me
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we
Me turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me, now who with me?
'V'monos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation, I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since second grade
He never told, who we gon' tell, we top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
You ain't fucking with my clique (Ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique)

Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

Break records at Louie, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the Un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talking to God for so long and if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique

Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the


Kanye West! (Swag King Cole) DJ Khaled!

Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga,
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some theraflu

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the theraflu

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter

Her love is all that I can see

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the
Gonna lock us up in a, home
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman
Ta being a president look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you round that
Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music

Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it


You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one is far to mean
The wattered down, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They it sound all wack and corny
Yes its awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well gather round children
Zip it listen!

Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
D.J's need to listen to the model's
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respawn the students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

At the mall there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with heroines
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
(And the fires did declare us)
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
(And moved her back in Paris)

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


I love it though
I love it though

Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us
May the God's be with us
And that magic hour
I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions
Oh she do it,
What happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up
She casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wantedt, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime

Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

(Satan, Satan, Satan)

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down its the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phoney

Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps


Yeah, they tried to put me in a box
It's impossible
Are-Les
(Oh yeah)
And this time it's all or nothing
(Set it real, oh yeah)
Listen

Show you how I put down with rocks, my lady
Promise you asking when I'm done for more
I'ma switch it up and make life comfortable

I'ma invade the thoughts you keeping maybe
If you're still not convinced, I'll tell you more
Make you forget the way you felt before
(Oh, oh)

You can be my first and leading lady
I'ma make you happy that you waited
For me to settle down

Burberry overcoat, new money attitude
A playboy you would know if you read the news
I could be with any other fine girl instead of you

Night life, city light, ride roof back
She's quite pretty nice, I?ll choose that
I'll be your publisher, you could be my centerfold
Long as you do me right, show me how I'm edible

And I'm a lead man, you could be my co-star
You been acting like your mind's right so far
And you the type that enjoy the best
The 4 star suites, ice, big toys and jets for real

Let me show you how its' supposed to feel
Mommy take them shoes off, lets close the deal
'Cause sunny you reached the top, stop social climbing
If my record don't sell we?ll still go diamond

(You're my diamond girl)


We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond


Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
It's for yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porscha" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A
R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)


Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say, she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo ingl's"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Y'all don't from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

Why you come here
I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found
See I'm often at your cross ways
Forgetting it was that Heaven let ya
They'd tried to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd tried to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down


Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin' involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin' lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them four's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, "Just a Lil' Bit" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie


La-da-da da-da da-da da-da da-da da
Blap!

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club look at here what we got
Some drunk and hot girls
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking 'bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

I don't want to drop your friends off, I just want you
You drunk and hot girl
You want to sit down but we hit the drive-thru

Please don't throw up in the car, we almost crashed
Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that
You drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

Love the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious
Above all things, love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh how, I want you right now

Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girl
"Ah da da da da." That's how the fuck you sound
You drunk and hot girl, yeah
You only live once, do whatever you like
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(A little sippy sippy)
We gonna through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(Want a little whisky)
(We go through too much bullshit to mess mess with these drunk
All of these drunk and hot girls)


Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat
I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey
Remember him from blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Ya see how I creeped up?
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their haircut
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the nigga-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award

Damn, here we go again
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killin's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
But Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am


Yo Jin, we good wit this one, yeah

Good lookin' Kanye, whoo
You see, we're the next generation in this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this, yup, uh oh

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

Yo I was doin' a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi and M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college, the other never went
We take turns doin' our one, twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name, tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West, what do you think is the best?
Take 'em backstage, get acquainted, that's what I suggest dog
When it comes to spittin' G, I'm one of the best y'all
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I got a way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci Parka, ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker, ain't no trickin today, hey
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got Play-Doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card, spendin cash' on Rodeo
And me? I'm at the Slauson Swap Meet
Lookin' for a pair of Air Ones and white tees
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies? Let's watch the bootleg

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
Or wore Versake, y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin, why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I Can't Believe It's Not Butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other 'cause plans change

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I've got a love, you ever was (it's over girl)
No good for me (I thought you and me was it, but obviously, things ain't work out)
I got a love, you ever was (and I know when you see this video) 
(The first thing you gon' do is pick up that cell phone) no good for me (and go to J, huh)

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

All these things


Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

I just wanted you to know

You can't stop the thing now
'Ey what a bam bam

Bam bam dilla, bam bam

'Ey what a bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free

And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt

I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my beautiful morning

Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted

You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!


Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazi

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights


I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh Indian
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I

Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
Oh, life's a feeling, yeah
Oh, the body's a feeling


The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out


This that rap god shit nigga
I rip every one of these motherfuckers down
Aye, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah

Close eyes, see things
Fire up, tweaking
You in my freak dreams
You in my freak dreams
Bad bitch, you dig that
Get stacks, drive cars
Whip out, bitch out
Tits out, oh shit
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
Fuck, can she fuck right now?
I done asked twice now
Can you bring your price down?
Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but I'm nice now
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
What the, what the fuck right now?
What if we fuck right now?
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this motherfuckin' dinner table?
What if we just fucked at the Vogue party
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody start fuckin'?
Would everybody start fuckin'?
Would everybody start fuckin'? They don't want nothin'
You motherfuckers living like half of your level, half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie
We be in the bathroom fucking like baby don't get too loud
I can, I can sing it, yeah

I want it right now
All of my niggas gon' get it in Chi now
You get hit with the pie now
Rolls with killer money nigga get by now
Right now, right now
I'm with niggas that have been to your side now
Side now, side down


[Mos Def]
History
Shoutin' it every day y'all (right now)
Every day (right now)
Right now (Good mornin', Vietnam!)

Listen
Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggaz again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and that's 'sta on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dope man of hip hop, now let's rock
Now roll out niggaz, my hometown niggaz
I get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
A screech go into a collision course with these walls - bam!
They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep
Light passin', light flashin, light pappers that pass, party done
Black hands of a rare
Black guns of a fair
Dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year
It's another day
It's the same fight
Different round, sound the bell
Mix it up and lift it where you live it up the beat
And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it
From the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep
From the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact with shorter emcee
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga]

[Jay-Z]
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah
Carried a fo'five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fry
Slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
Thinkin either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms
Doin five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin

[Kanye West]
I'm back the way that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michaelangelo paintin' a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music gets you choked up this is the tree and a rope
This is Chi nigga, I'm Mr. Alla That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on a almanac
Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me toughen up
Put some bass in your voice
They used to tell me lighten up
Put some Mase in your voice
Lord willin' I ain't kilt nobody
But I have a feelin' this album
That I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shilling
This is love it or hate it music
But, at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry
This is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me or I'm finna be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more
We're makin' history

[background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

[background singers repeat in the background]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[background singers]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by

We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
Desensitized to the violence on TV during the war
Killin each other is easy as pourin liquor for fallen niggaz 
Believe me, it's ghetto libations, seen it all befo'
Just to get by, my people we get fly
My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lye
Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne
I send the rest in peace to Nina Simone

[Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We would hustle when fiends would ask for it
Yes I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggaz and street motherfuckers
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call to my mother
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
(Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma)
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building session to get by

[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

[background singers repeat in the background]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Some people try
Some people try just to get by
For a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive and we lie
And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo
People decide
Keeper of the skies
Can't see your eyes
See the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger or feeble in mind
I stay readin' the signs
yo-yo-yo-yo yo
[repeat]


I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)

N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hell, a problems
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you feel me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, or to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful but this
Bastard's flow will bash a skull and I will
Cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we assholes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cause we don't want to here that weak shit no mo'

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)

Now now now now now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26, tellin' me that she 36-26,
Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E
At NYU but she hail from Kansas,
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes but
Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it

Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
With real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)


Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh

Yo, you know me I'm with the ghetto diva, stiletto fever
Jello shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply, I'm back on top,
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop.
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of Patron, gettin' top on yachts.
The medallions are mountin' rock on rock
The whole world want to know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't get brains I told her, let me get knowledge yourself
I told be proud of yourself and dig deep,
And try and see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back 
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn if I call back, what

Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh
Shorty gettin' it in with me, yeah

'Cause they ain't gettin' in with me, uh-uh

I'm with this bad Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liqueur
I told her I'm Nigerian that's straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try an treat me like I ain't famous.
My apologies are you into astrology 'cause, um, I'm trying to make it to Uranus 
See that's a little Don Juan game,
All across your chest like Sean Jean name
Niggas tryin' to figure out, since kan' came
Who's the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype.
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight.
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til your broke, my nigga live your life

Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh
Shorty gettin' it in with me, yeah
She said I brought some friends for me but I don't know why 
'Cause they ain't gettin' in with me, uh-uh

'Cause they ain't gettin' in with me, uh-uh

Shorty getting it in with me, 600 Benz with me 
She want to spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club 
'Cause I got my men's with me
She said she leaving her friends for me, they ain't gettin' in with her 
'Cause she goin' bend for me
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me, 
Look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me using her mouth for me, 
She looking out for me, 
She said 'kiss where you live, I said you see the bridge, 
When you step on the balcony
Let's go

Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh

'Cause they ain't gettin' in with me, uh-uh


Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on Sunday
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Each one, knowing how 'm livin', smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna, some days

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray, it's not enough
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go (go), of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free


I'm known for running my mouth
I will not be accountable for what comes out, uh
I dunno, I might have said it
I was kinda gone and light-headed
And my jacket kinda fresh bright reded
And as usual my pants tight-threaded
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
Don't get it twisted it or dreaded it
I am the king and will not beheaded,
To the mall no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin,
That'll only get my engine revvin'
While y'all on ten, I'm on eleven
I'm a make the news, be on at seven
Matter fact I'm on this very second
I'm in first and y'all in second.
And this verse only add to the freshness
Call the club, tell them add to the guest list
What you think? Way more bitches?
I can never be too big for my britches
Y'all motherfuckas know who this is
I'm gifted,
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time

You don't know my mind
Like I said a thousand times
I gotta stay ahead
Know what I'm fighting for
I leave you to your talk
Never seen my kind before
And you're all so thick-headed
Follow and I know I let it
Part of me won't let me quit
Won't let me just not say shit
So much is there to be bored with
Can't be still, I can't afford it
Try to hold it in but it make me sick,
So I spit it out say the hell with it
I dream it and I build it tall
Make a way for when it falls

I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time

I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the

I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time


[Intro]
And we go by the runners
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
DJ Khaled, we the best
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
I do it for the hood, cause the hood told me I should
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
If you rep yo' hood and you goin' hard
If the they hatin' on you don't stress,
Tell them niggas that we the best
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
You can't stop this
Fuck the best, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled, and Pain

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me,
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me,
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go 
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end, 
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ughh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad won't nobody get up on it, I
Flow sick, nigga how sick, sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get,
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip, 
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it,
No I ain't gon have it

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me,
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me,
You should already figure Imma go hard
If you was as real as me,
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me,
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go,
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end, 
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scared 
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon' head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt,
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt Like I couldn't really give it my all,
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall,
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me,
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't no where to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now 
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old, well it's good I'm young
'Fore my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one?
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me,
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here


[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure Imma go hard
If you was as real as me,
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go 
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end, 
I got to go, go, go, go hard



She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town, that digs on me

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm."
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Let me hear that back


She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed

Let me hear that back


Wished I had told, was the only one (uh-oh)
But it's too late, it's too late
She's gone

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Too late, we gone, we strivin' home
Gone, I ride on chrome
It's too late

Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Are-are-are-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

We strivin home, gone
I ride on chrome
We strivin' home, gone
Killa, I ride on chrome

Knock knock, who's there
Killa Cam, Killa who
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin' to the dealer
No concealin', no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doin' puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just goin' tell 'em (Too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (Gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you want to see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin' like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin' my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin' alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

We strivin' home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that
Cause

I been pourin' out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented "Gone With the Wind," cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

I'm
Ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me want to get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin' it all behind
Kanye step away from the limelight, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin' over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen year old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirror
How we out in Europe, spendin' Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'mma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin' the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorty's at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where niggaz that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got more (Ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles

Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
(I wish a nigga would)
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good


Uh, good morning

Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation

Good morning

On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of

Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit wear cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters sayin' ya changed
Now ya doin' ya thang

Good morning

Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life, if you try to
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow
No goodbye

I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

Uh, to you
If I part my heart will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true


Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said,
"I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it,
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Niggas gossiping, it runs the city, they don't know who watching them 
When they coming to get me, so I hit the block and bend 
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow 

I'm gonna to get on this TV and put shit down 
I aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style 
I'm finna turn to this class clown, should be crazy deep 
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D. 
I told em, what-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller 
The dream spoilers are for ya 
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners 
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner 
They are the virus that corrupts the soul 
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold 
That get green on ya, when you get green on em 
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em 
Somebody told me success is the best revenge 
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em 
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought 
And tell em, ahem, thank you for your no support 

They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers 
Who know a dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers, dream 
They are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 

Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money 
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money 
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is 
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration 
Cos we the leaders, and they the followers 
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers 
They are the rumours, they are the lies 
We are the shit dog, and they the flies 
How you gon tell me how to live my life 
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right 
They are the misery that loves company 
Cuz that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me 
Told em I finished school, and I started my own business 
They said 'Oh you graduated?' No I decided I was finished 
Chasin yall dreams and what you got planned 
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned 
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up 
Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character 
Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya 
Come around wit ya but they ain't down wit ya 
They the dreamkillers 

And I'm through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow 
They be like 'That's cool, you got some beats for me though?' 
Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre 
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say 
Anyway what you finna rap about? 
You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth 
Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd? 
I bet a thousand that you get booed out 
I even heard that they even takin wages in jail 
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail 
Second you talk about me, they be like 'Peace' 
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the east 
You gotta kill at least one person at least 
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease 
How you go to New York, what you ain't never took a tour there? 
What you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there? 
The dreamkillers 

Niggas gossiping, it runs the city 
They don't know who watching them 
When they coming to get me 
So I hit the block and bend and do about 60 
And I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow 




What in the fuck was that Kanye
I told you to do some shit for the kids
You can give me your motherfucking graduation ticket right now
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A motherfucker can't pull you across that stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trying to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mother hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Mother what you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me but don't anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody


Oh it can't Be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam be	
But you niggas gon' get in 'til you get to Miami

G-L-C goin' be stoned as Angie
I be Don see, Johnny Patron, and me
It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign
In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain
And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn
Dog I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the chi the city of hella haters
Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back of hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them fagots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing

Dog it can't be
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family
A little bit a stuntin' flickin' dog it ain't deep
I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lakeshore Drive, The Grammy Family

Uh,uh,uh
Ghea uh,uh it's the Cons fool, word

Oh it can't Be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam be	

And after music meetings wit evenings with Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we, be in Miami
So when they spot me in Bentley it's gon be a stampede
'cause we be racing Bentley's no different than Grand Prix's
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And sense I got my shot like I was call and man be	
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan be	
We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby
Headin' to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step
So what y'all wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is

Oh, oh, oh, the grammy family

La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight
Oh it's alright, it's alright, yeah


I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
Another one, leprechaun
Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life
I'm living mine

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay

Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, peeking through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
'Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

Oh, oh, oh

If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?

Let me go, let me go, let me go

(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like Rob would say
Before you ask me to get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil' cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of the noun

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

Cause every worthless word we got more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way


In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just goin' keep hatin' me
And we just goin' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm goin' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?


Feat. GLC
[Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself, they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds

Let the beat ride out for a minute

[GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be...
(GLC where you at nigga?)

How many niggas you know put their life on the line and get signed
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and ye
And offers to sell and yell, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]


I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the C.P.R.
She gave that old nigga an ulcer
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh)
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh)
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh)
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh)
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what)
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh)
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah)

Have you lost your mind
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You can hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gang bang
It's kinda crazy, that's opposite the same thing
Well I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if you run trains, we all in the same game
Run away slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change
That's a dress of her back and told her get away
How can they say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck wit' the lights on
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)

Have you lost your mind
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grand my hand
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life


(Hey mama) I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (hey mama)

(Hey mama) I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say Mama, now everybody answer me (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (hey mama)

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (hey mama)

(Hey mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (hey mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine

Only problem is I'm rich

We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan
Life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm
I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget
Soon as she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches huh?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian huh?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back huh
What you want?
You want a boss or an R
nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox

I can hold my liquor
What this man can't handle is me
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

I heard you need a new fad
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round 
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down 
A lot of soldiers aint make it through this year 
So lets just celebrate that we still here and

Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home 
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone 
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home 
I'll be coming home


My homie called me like what up man 
Not from Florida but what up fam 
It's been a whole lot of hatin again 
And if they hatin on me damn what up then 
I met this girl when I was three years old 
and what I love most she had so much soul 
She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me but uh my name is wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees 
and from that point I never blow her off 
niggas come from out of town I like to show her off 
They like to act tough she like to tore em off 
and make them straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft 
and when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown 
and at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be 
She never mess with entertainers 'cuz they always leave 
She said it feel like you walked and drove on me 
knew I was gang affiliated got on t.v. and told on me 
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me 
She said Ye, keep makin that platinum and gold for me 
but if you really cared for her 
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams 
Sometimes I still talk to her 
but when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me 
She said you left ya kids and they just like you 
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 
but they just not you 
and I just got through 
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new 
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong 
I guess you never know what you got till is gone 
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home 
and guess when I heard that when I was back home 
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud 
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds 
Jump in the crowds 
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around 
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town 


(Chorus) 
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round 
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down 
A lot of soldiers aint make it through this year 
So lets just celebrate that we still here and 
Whoooooooaa
Never leave me alooooooooone 
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home 
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone 
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home 
I'll be coming home



I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again

Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again


I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

I am a God
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn m'nage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a God
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hands of God
So y'all better quit playing with God

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper who compared to Michael
So here's a few hating ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake ass niggas to bite you
I don't wanna hear what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink ass polos with a fucking backpack
Everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody else swag man we the rat pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants

I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

I just talked to Jesus, he said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling, trying to stack these millions"
I know he the most high but I am a close high
Mi casa es su casa, that's that cosa nostra

I am a God
I am a God
I am a God


Yo Jin, we good wit this one, yeah

Good lookin' Kanye, whoo
You see, we're the next generation in this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this, yup, uh oh

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

Yo I was doin' a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi and M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college, the other never went
We take turns doin' our one, twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name, tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West, what do you think is the best?
Take 'em backstage, get acquainted, that's what I suggest dog
When it comes to spittin' G, I'm one of the best y'all
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I got a way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci Parka, ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker, ain't no trickin today, hey
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got Play-Doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card, spendin cash' on Rodeo
And me? I'm at the Slauson Swap Meet
Lookin' for a pair of Air Ones and white tees
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies? Let's watch the bootleg

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
Or wore Versake, y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin, why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I Can't Believe It's Not Butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other 'cause plans change

I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I've got a love, you ever was (it's over girl)
No good for me (I thought you and me was it, but obviously, things ain't work out)
I got a love, you ever was (and I know when you see this video) 
(The first thing you gon' do is pick up that cell phone) no good for me (and go to J, huh)


I miss the old Kanye, straight from the go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye, hahaha


[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know

[Verse 1]
I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn 
That white benz, dyke twins
I aint gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin cuz it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin
You been telling them jokes, and its not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fo I pay for this room cuz

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Now if you got it you got it
And if you don't then you prolly wont
Sissy niggaz call em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em
By em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em
Take em back to confuse em
So she don't know if she coming or going
Cuz mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Back to show just frontin and flowin
Jewelry stuntin and glowin, this life is something I know it
And I been known to have a hoe or two
Cuz my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you
After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin and havin sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep em impressed
Let em seat in the Lex, never, eat em unless
That fuckin cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

[Chorus x2]



I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it (I know, I know, I know, I know, know)

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself 
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
(Mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say, "Don't say this, don't say that"
Just say out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
(Mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhm'mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good 
To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself 
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say, "He died so young"
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't signed to so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay


Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams


One glad morning, when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end, oh
I'll fly away

Oh I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away


[Kanye West]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Agent Sasco]
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)
That's all them can do
We deal with action thing
Just a badman thing a dat dem cab do
Action thing yo a badman thing

Man a badman you fi know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
Thats hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)
We ago smile pan court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J

[Kanye West and Justin Vernon]
That's right I'm in it (Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it (Stepping on tacks on the floor)
That's right (And boys at your door)
That's right I'm in it (Well you need to fight for your own)
That's right I'm in it (Then don't let me at your table)
I'm in it (If you just gonna lay there)
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
I'll be gone long, grab that ????, set your ??

[Kanye West]
Picked up where we left off
I need you home when I get off
You know I need that wet mouth
I know you need that reptile
She cut from a different textile
She love different kinds of sex now
Black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
Lay it off, it off, it off.
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Who? Where?

[Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Michael Douglas out the car now
The kids and the wife life
But can't wake up from the night life
I'm so scared of my demons
I go to sleep with a nightlight
My mind move like a Tron bike
Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
I'm gonna start a new movement
Being led by the drums
I'm a rap-lic priest
Getting head by the nuns
They don't play what I'm playing
They don't see what I'm saying
They be balling in the D-League
I be speaking Swaghili


Yeah Yeah
Class Heat
I'm the shit
Yeah Baltimore Club Music
Yeah I'm The shit
I got them diamonds on my neck
Got Patron in my cup
If you wanna come and get it
Shawty I don't give a f*ck
See it's Friday night
And I just got paid

Now it's time To Celebrate
Well the DJ played my shit
Some of that club music shit

Because I'm always out of town
Is that your girlfriend

Her booty's fat like yours

I know the club is bout to close
But it's only 3 o'clock

[Jermaine]
See now I'd probably been in this shit the longest
I don't deal with the fake and the phoniest
Girls treat me like I'm one of the Jones's
Give her dick and all types of bonuses
I don't really even know who song this is
But I heard it and jumped right on this shit
If the shoe fit you better wear it
And I swear it you see me

She asked me what my name is
Told her I was famous
You don't know who Jermaine is
She must be brainless
Since the day I came in
Don't know where them lames went
But that ain't no issue
Baby get your boy some tissue

Cause I'm the shit
Fish you as my whistle
Got your chick she doesn't miss you
She'll be with you when she kiss you
She'll be licking on my missile
No homo see my logo
And you'll hold shows like it's promo
It's tight I had to force it
Now they call me porcelain

Cause I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit

For you to ever deny, that I'm about chi-town
Represent the city with the deal for 12 years and sell a couple a mil and still hold it down, That's possible

Get it, bundled up and, lit it, smoke a lil' blunt don't, admit it
Do it like I did too late, I did it
The controversy can't worse me man, I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty what is you saying
I gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying, hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
Man your life must be perfect man, look at how they came up with the perfect plan
Its impossible
Got strip clubs playing gosspital
Girl so sick in the hospital
You know I jumped out like pakadu
I only break it down I when I rock wit you
Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you
I done did shit on logical
Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible

No matter what I do, see I been waiting all my, waiting all my life, yeah,

Get it, bundled up and, lit it, smoke a lil' blunt don't, admit it
Do it like I did too late, I did it
The controversy can't worse me man, I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty what is you saying
I gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying, hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
Man your life must be perfect man, look at how they came up with the perfect plan
Its impossible
Got strip clubs playing gosspital
Girl so sick in the hospital
You know I jumped out like pakadu
I only break it down I when I rock wit you
Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you
I done did shit on logical
Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible

No matter what I do, see I been waiting all my, waiting all my life, yeah, 
And I know I stayed on my grind, I know I stayed on my grind,
Its impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on moving, 
Gotta keep on moving, its impossible 

(Its just impossible) (it's impossible)


[Talking]
Something I did Something I don't 
I can't explain how to 
I cant' speak for everybody but 

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise 
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys 
and mess with other girls part time to improvise 
I knew she wouldn't ride though I seen it in her eyes 
And I'm like any other guy tryin' get in her thighs 
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise 
And I'm like if you don't get yo' ass in this ride from Enterprise 
That I rented yesterday and got to have in by 5 
With the gass fully filled up like I didn't drive 
Told her I had a girl, dawg fuck it I didn't lie 
told this rap game is all right I'm just getting by 
She had a little weed and we get a little high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe 
boo back in 92 I was just like you 
Please don't get confused by the ice and jewels 
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool 
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school 
And think yeah Free's banging but she no Rachel 

[Chorus] 
We ball till we fall 
Hit the mall 
After we hit don't call 
Fill your lives 
With nothing but lies 
And I would like to apoligize 
(repeat twice) 

You can't stand right here 
And tell me everything is going to be all right 
Cuz until the day a real man stands up I'm going have to improvise 

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong yeah I know I'm wrong 
She's at home alone and I'm always gone 
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive 
Now she on the internet looking for classes 
Out of state though, man that hurt yo 
But I got work though and I'm at work yo 
And she don't call alot but when she do she pouring out her heart 
You never listen to me then the call drop mmmmm 
And I promised her everything 
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring 
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring 
Fighting my urges 
Strip club splurges 
Never had money so I felt like a virgin 
And I'm trying to break the banks cherry 
Trying see can I afford Carnaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry 
Went from 50gs to 50 hundred in a week 
Now I'm trying to call 
One ring, two ring, seven ring, eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone 
Like she at school and she don't stay here no more 

I guess it's more good women than men percentage wise 
So her chance of having a husband in minimize 
I guess that's why she say she ain't into guys 
Focus on school full time to improvise 

[Chorus]


We are currently missing these lyrics.


Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wondering could you do a lil' som
Something beautiful
Something that the kids is goin love when they hear it
Thats goin' make them start jumping up and down and sharing candy an' stuff
Think you could probably do something for the kids for graduation to sing?


We are currently missing these lyrics.


Order, huh
Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)

You know what the Midwest is?
Young and Restless
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so long

So long
(Jesus Walks with me)

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now

[Intro: ODB (K. West)]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! {*continues until chorus comes in*}
Yo this is Dirt McGirt, I'm chillin' wit Kanye West
He's killin' y'all niggaz on the beats
He's killin' y'all niggaz on the tracks
(Where ya plaques at dog?)
The game is officially over!
Go kill yaself!

[Chorus: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not mothafucka, it's The Roc mothafucka!

[Kanye West]
Keep the Receipt mothafuckas!
Now y'all gon' stop talkin' that shit that you talkin'
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the Hell so gon' afford that coffin?
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the shot since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggaz had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggaz postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters
Dog, niggaz had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards.. HUMPH!
Now after all that it took
I made it to The Roc, I'm guess I ain't as dumb as you look

[Chorus x2]

[Kanye West]
Now.. I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you nigga's tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rappin' and I can't do nothin' for ya, man
S.G'll hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov', if you ain't Cam'
Damn, I know you say he's killin' hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feelin' hisself
Yup, just cuz I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who ya hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast 
&
Furious
You goin' through movin' critters, now who's laughin'?
The best producer that rap better than the rappers

[Chorus x2 - last line by K. West the 2nd time]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard (K. West)]
Aftermath still makin' them hits, nigga?
Lunatics still makin' them hits, nigga?
So So Def still makin' them hits, nigga?
Bad Boy still makin' them hits, nigga?
Wu-Tang still makin' them hits, nigga?
Ruff Ryders still makin' them hits, nigga?
(Cash Money) still makin' them hits, nigga?
Dirt McGirt still makin' them hits, nigga

Yo yo the game is over, go kill yaself!
Go kill yaself.. nigga!

We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more!



Til the casket drops
Third times a charm right?
Haha
Come on!

I'm kinda like a big deal
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow runnin' on Big's heels
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou- in a recession
With no second guessin'
Haha we're ballin, drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-up is the gang and I'm all in!
To the powder and the flame I have fallin'
Get money blow money is my callin'
Yeah! Watch a n---a burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!

[Chorus]
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal...

Ay yo I'm sittin on top of the-
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'-
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a n----a be
Spittin' fire on the PJ in my PJ's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like TJ
Yea people I said Marshalls we play
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend come fast?
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes

[Chorus]

Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I be hoppin the ring, n----s ya cash in
It's like stoppin a train,
N---a think he's stoppin my reign
Talk slick while droppin my name?
I'm puttin y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I X out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'
The C4S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average joe
But just as you reap, so shall you so...

[Chorus]


Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate, that they're serving on a platter
So what we goin' have, dessert or disaster

I never thought I'd, be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in, and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking bout our life our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

I never thought I'd
Hear myself say (ooh)
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today (kick it wit my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flying high (flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)

Hey, now I'm crashing, don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never too much
She helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight,
Girl sometimes love

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams that
Seem to only date the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughing
We, were never meant to be baby we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us

Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average

For advice
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him

Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will u bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens (hey)
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
Yeah


Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking

I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker!

And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

"Last call for alcohol, for my niggas"

So this A
over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. 
And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. 
I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. 
And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"


I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

[Jay-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[Jay-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[Jay-Z: "so what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: "Come on, let's just go"]

Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up

[Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat
To DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said "man that was tight."

[Jay-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A
's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A
's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. 
So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"

So won't you raise your glass, won't you
So won't you raise your glass, won't you
So won't you raise your glass, won't you
So won't you raise your glass, won't you


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right

Stop all your blood clot cryin, I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin baby

I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right

You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah


[Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.


[Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make


[Drake]
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down


[Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker

[Lupe Fiasco]
guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterwerf
But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like I'm layin on the street.
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touch
'
' Lupe cool as the Unthawed,
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star,
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.

Fendi spas Paddington bags
Cockiness to add in ya swag

Cops'll pull you over like isn't there a problem?
No sir,
But I realize the windows so blur
That you might've mistaked a nigga for a chauffeur
Ya might mistake that backseat for a sofur (sofa)
Now the dreads said to rap on everything
Cause he know that I snap on everything
Listen, when my flow commissions
It caused the commissioner to throw a cap on everything
My accountant said
If I get the crib on the side of the mountain
Right beside the fountain
And decide on the Phantom
I'd go broker than Hammer
Performin' in pajamas
Damn it

You keep askin' questions

Can't blame them but whoever they writers is
Matter fact whoever the dick riders is
Get your own style don't Winona Ryder his
Ferrari Fab or you could say Spyder Spizz
SLR pullin' up on the side of his
Shorty's success ain't even near as hot as his
This dudes paper thinner than Easy Wadha is
I made me laugh yo
But if you do the math though
I've been gettin' money since Kojak had a afro
I've been fresh since
Will Smith was a Fresh Prince
Had hos when Kermit was a tadpole
So of course the officers wanna off us
Came off the corner to up in the corner office
I thought it was livin'
They call it ballin'
It been like this
Where the hell all of y'all been?

You keep askin' questions
Dumbass suggestions
Must ain't never lived like this
Why the funny faces

Hey Jimmy where you going?

I don't know where I'm going.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?",
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.
These are documented.
My father left them for me.
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.
I'm going to learn too.
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.
Who has that

You're now fuckin' with the best in the world

Lollipop (The best in the world, world)

Shorty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump you know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps

Shorty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno flicking actor
I Anita Bake her now she caught up in that rapture
I got so much chips
I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips
you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother fudge cake
Now tell me how that fudge taste
I do it for Bloods sake
Sulu, thinks its voodoo
How the roof do do dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so so so-phisticate
Cuz her brains is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in choir
Because they sangin from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because
All she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin

Wayne and Kanye pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut
Then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her make an appointment with 
Mr. I can't make an appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it
Remix!

Shorty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump you know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps

Why would she
She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag bout to get crushed by a buildin'
I've flushed out the feeling of
Me being the shit
Cuz I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
And I am everywhere
I'm it like hide-n-go and I can go
Anywhere, innie minnie mynie mo
Im in yo
Neighborhood, area, cd thing tape deck
iPod, your girlfriend and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex
Better wear a latex
Cuz you dont want that late text
That "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up
But he so sweet, she wanna lick the wrapper

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line

So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to

So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose


You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart
And my soul, with every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me

Every morning, every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night
And I won't always have to wake up by myself 
Wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he, he's gonna be there for me

Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears 
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like

No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life


Have you screamin' like 6 in the mornin'
Legs in the air I'm on them hips in the mornin'
Still feel it in your ribs while your walkin'
Sip some cognac ? contact
And I'll put you on a one year contract
I'm saying to you
Please believe baby Joe that Royce
Now the game, I took the throwback off
He playing witchu

[Chorus]
Is there any boys around
that know how to make a girl feel?
that wanna make a girl feel,
make her feel good?
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
that know how to make a girl feel?
that wanna make a girl feel,
make her feel good?
I just wanna know

Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong,
when it ain't strong?
keep my mouth closed?
(huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie,
that ain't just tryna hang around me?

Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me,
every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke cause he go
(mh girl no)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
that wanna do more than spend money on me?

[Chorus]

How come I got a nigga but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil' somethin'?
and every girl on my block can't say they don' bumped wit?

I'm so tired of these so called wanna be hard cold pretenders that
(have no clue)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
that I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?

[Chorus]

why why is it so hard
hard for a girl like me to find a boy
that really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
why is it so hard
hard for a girl like me to find a boy
that really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
I just wanna know

You wanna deal wit' an O-G that's truly respected
Touch you in every spot that them dudes neglected
A dude that won't flirt, a dude put her to work
Beat it up til it hurt, she like uh uh uh (OK)
And you're the only one that I really wanna chill wit'
I know how you dude to make you feel missed
I take the front of ma, show you the realness
All nigga really needs is a lil' bit
From a hood chick lookin' straight off the runway
Won't bite her tongue, shorty'll say what she wan' say
From Sunday to Monday
She gon' ride whether it's in back of the Phantom or in back of the Hyundai
Not the fake baler throwin' cream in your face
Or dude that won't fall til he cream in your
Or dude to see you walkin' in them jeans and wanna taste
I'm who the call when they wanna steam up the place (Joe)

[Chorus]


I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh-oh

She wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day
Eh, I mean staring like a creeper cause you gotta peep ?er
I mean you probably might be saying you ain't jockin? either
But man, o girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, the type that make you tell a be!tch just dance
And fuck them other niggas cause you down for her be!tches
Fuck them other niggas cause she down for the stickin?
And fuck them other niggas hope she down for some lickin?
And fuck them other be!tches
Cause she?s down for the trickin? up

And she spit it up and swallow now

But me and mammy know who can really make her go

Lady Gaga

Now we gone? have a hell of a night
Through the day
I made her say
Hold up, born in 88
How old is that? Old enough
I got seniority with the sorority
So, that explain why I love college
Gettin? brain in the library cause I love knowledge
When you use your Medulla Oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I comatoses
And do it while I sleep yeah a little osmosis
And that?s my commitment you ain?t gotta ask Moses
More champagne more toast?es
More damn planes, more coast?es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa?

I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
When I
P-p-p-poker face

When I
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poke her face
I make her say

Common
She said she want whatever she like
But she gotta bring your friend
We could have a hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A poker face book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
Its the way I was raised on the south side safari, so

Lady GaGa
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
(When I)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poke her face
(I make her say)

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
(When I)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poke her face

Lady Gaga
Can?t read my, can?t read my
No he can?t read my poker face

Cause I'm in it to win now niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

Martin Louis the King Jr.
Starting, all that stuntin' is gonna ruin ya
B.I. was alive he probably had a two tone
With the Grey Poupon
Anything yay poop on
Will explode
Cause I am the shit and this is my commode
Uh oh there they go
Talking about how ya boy clothes extra tight
I just remember that my limelight extra bright
I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype,
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not getting no sex tonight
And a lap dance will probably be a blessing right.
So all the shit you talking dead, coffin
Light the weed coughing, new crib loftin'
Where it's at? Austin, where's that? Texas
What's in front? Benz's, what else? Lexus
Well who's Maybach is this? Mr. West's

Realest shit I ever wrote chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie I'ma make back

Crib need custodians
Shades in all shades

Use to be the Oldsmo
Hoes call it oh low
Now I got so many horses
Bitches call me Polo
5762 tell me how ya wanna move
Yea you know I got them both,
Beat your ass black and blue
I was barely getting pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Looking in the mirror I can see the real contender
Celery for even Gregory I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is ya telling me other than your gender
I'm a boss and I'm riding like a small fault,
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'til they fall off yea Ross!

Realest shit I ever wrote chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie I'ma make back

Cause I'm in it to win now niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

Classy as a mother still gutter like a bad bowl
Benjamin Franklin on x how the cash row
That's right them mill due like damn clothes

We don't feel you
And we be strapping up like the navy seal do
Sweet as banana split every time I peel through,
Fresher than will smith and uncle Phil too
Watching T-V in the Maybach in traffic,
I'm on my feet like tough acting Tinactin
I'm running this shit
You should try tackling,
Lil Wayne in one word immaculate,
You see the Biggie, you see the Jay, the Tupac in him,
The Kurt Cobain, the Andre three stacks
And then I'm back to doing shit like I do sing Maybach music

Realest shit I ever wrote chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie I'ma make back

How these niggas so one-track minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget barbie fuck Nicki she's fake

No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R
singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing
I think that pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Ladies say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical, make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with uni fee
And I walk through with ease, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary, scary
No more parties in LA
Please baby, no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And a Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use their kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of week content of slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know that L.A. is so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some got damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played to me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't've popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the road so I ain't never drivin'
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out
Got damn, got up of fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-drop-drop-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends tell my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

Please baby no more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh


I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em tea just we almost white
Almost

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Niggaz wanna diss K
On they're local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya
A little arrogant with all your compares
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most black sister beginnin' to rap
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie whole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
When you prepare, would you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars, all better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
I did it my way




Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale, Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it

"Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody want to be Hov and Hov's still alive


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo what you doing here huh?
(Hi I thought I'd drop by so nice to see you)
Nice to see you too okay
(It's been too long)
Yeah you can leave now

[Verse 1]
Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Told a long time ago you can't fuck every hoe
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred
Shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin
Call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts
Look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message
I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Day with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course
Alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay
On the three way
Talking bout "You can't call a bitch on her BDay?"
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over
"So what you saying?"
Look you gotta bounce
"I don't wanna fuck with you, get your hands off me!"
Bitch I ain't touching you
Stop
Chill
Relax okay, you know what she told me?

[Chorus]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go (x2)
(Never letting go?)
(I only known you for what.. you talking about man)

I'm crazy about you
(Naw you just crazy)

[Verse 2]
You believe this hoe
Pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show
Pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like
"Oh you wash dishes here?"
Pop up in my bathroom
"Oh you take pisses here?"
Listen here we gone need some distance here
"Where I'm gone go?"
I don't care
Just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib
Then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side "Kanye you ain't shit"
You believe this bitch?
Lennet you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my escalade?
"Ha yeah nigga!"
Thats a twelve fuckin hundred dollar estimate
She must've took up all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars 
Screaming at the top of her lungs
"I'm never letting go!"

[Chorus]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go (x2)
(Shit this nigga ain't gettin up out of this that easy
I'm getting something out of this)

I'm crazy about you
(Naw you just crazy)

[Verse 3]
Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like "Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time"
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
"Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!"
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door
"Nigga don't ever fuck with me"
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a slow nigga thought that he could lift the fan
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

[Chorus]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go (x3)

I'm crazy about you
(Naw you just crazy)

Uh oh uh oh these hoes these hoes all the same all the same
All want a nigga with a chain

Uh oh uh oh these hoes these hoes all the same all the same
Want a nigga whippin that range

Uh oh uh oh these hoes these hoes all the same all the same
Want a nigga banging they brains

Uh oh uh oh these hoes these hoes these hoes these hoes these hoes

It's been too long


Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer (Woo!) write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yughck)
(Matching Daytonas, rose gold on us)
Goin' H'A'M in Ibiza done took a toll on us (ooh!)
(But since you over do it, I'mma pour more)
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

Shake that body, party that bod (That's rare nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Rick Flare nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (Yeah nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G.O.D (yeah)

Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)
Shake that body, party that body (It's a new God flow niggas!)
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

Step on they necks 'til they can't breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier (Woo!)
(Woo!) They shitty shoppin' at Targ't (Woo!)
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (Ay!)
Im ballin', Amar'e
A nick' sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Ha!)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yughck!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams,
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told (I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes (If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes (I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes (Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!


My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prisons
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long
You cannot survive
And I'm not dying
And I can't lose
I can't lose
No, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again
Too high)


Believe it or not
Believe it or not

Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

Take the top off, let the sun come in (on you)
Woah, for all my dogs that stay down, we up again (yeah) 
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had dead on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs "turn the snuffs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not)
These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not)
I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not)
The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you
Truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you
Too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (ooh wee)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (ooh wee)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you


No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R
singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing
I think that pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Ladies say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical, make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with uni fee
And I walk through with ease, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary, scary
No more parties in LA
Please baby, no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And a Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use their kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of week content of slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know that L.A. is so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some got damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played to me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't've popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the road so I ain't never drivin'
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out
Got damn, got up of fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-drop-drop-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends tell my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

Please baby no more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA, uh


Ooh I promise not to do it again

You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
'Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do

And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit
And I don't want to cheat but I don't be saying shit

But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite

You know that I love you (know that I love you)

Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, huh?

On sight, on sight

How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up

He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncing
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

On sight, on sight

Uh-huh
Right now, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now


'As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, 'cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
'Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world 'cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me


[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh



[John Legend]
We cant even sit and talk, without you arguing
You're the one who started it

[Kanye West]
[Verse 1]
I got a girl at home but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove cuz she wont look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery hoe
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said 'I hope its not too ghetto'
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be +Daly+ like Carson is
But the problem is..

[Chorus]
We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no
You're the one who started it

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my porches
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake rollie
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship'll go off, you know me
I aint call you, you wanna know why?
Im in Noha, Hon aloha, pushin jet skis so I
Couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun? Stays down there
What's happenin here? Made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
But the problem is..

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Man, boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after 2 or 3 or 4
I aint messin with them girls no more
It's weak, the benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, 'You must love that car more than me
And nigga I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities
If she went with Fabolous I bet that she would be
A-R-G-U-I-N-G and please
I'm not actin like this cuz I'm getting spins on
W-K-R-B in Cincinnati
You think I'd get my voice so deep like
W-K-R-B in Cincinnati
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this?

[Chorus x2]



[*GLC talking*]
You know what I'm sayin'? He came in
He made music sound different, you know?
Makin', uh, good beats and shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
He was doin' shit motherfuckers wasn't doin'
Makin soul shit, I grew up on soul
I was eatin' celery and soul food at a young age
You know what I'm sayin'? Collard greens and all that shit
So I can really appreciate what Kanye West do
He done made shit I can step to
I'm a old motherfucker that like to step
This nigga make beats I can step to
So I like that shit

[Kanye West]
Yo I'm really thinkin' about gettin' out the game dog
Look, there's only one girl on my agenda
(You talkin' 'bout Brenda?)
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout Linda from last September
And Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
La Face says she like Mace but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hip hop head
And I know that Linda gave hip hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her man
And she was messin' with me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whipped cream
Shakespearean "Midsummer Night Dream"
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin' gr-green, she was like ch-ching, got 'em
But she know a real nigga when she spot 'em
So now she pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin' out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin' at the bar with all my guys
They sayin' "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog, you ready to give all this shit up?"
The summer's on its way and these hos doin' sit ups
And when they see the way the G5 lights lit up
You gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the word "go"
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darla Nicky, co-star of my quickie
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That broad, those titties, those are her titties
So large so pretty, but not to rub it in
But them white Russians did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh


Why are you so paranoid

You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I could make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight oh here we go

Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed

Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor
Anyway they don't know you like I do

Anyway they don't know you like I do

Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you


[Verse 1]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama benz JEEP
We'll put 50 I get this on the first take
But that 50'll break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim
Had a girl nickname sprewell cuz when I tried to stop
She still made me spend
Back when Avies was in, my dog crazy kid had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again
And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said 'This car real old'; I told her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club
And get a girl that's into the fitness
Tryin to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get insiiiide

[Chorus]
Now I been hustling my whole life
Tryin to get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I been polly'n with this one girl that claim 'I gotta work tomorrow'
But tonight's the night, so poor another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doin fine

[Verse 2]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Please, what I gotta win 5 Grammy's before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys
If I cant bone, I get a clone, get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She vibin, don't stop her there, told me that she love the Roc so much 
She drove all the way to far Rockaway, for a Rocawear
More populaire, cuz I abracadabra'd my Nissan
To a car throwin the peace sign, PEACE
Damn that's like the same line I used in the first verse
But w-w-w-wait it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K, before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew's CK
In a CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
Im tryna find a crazy fe-male wit a cutee face
I big pimp her on the the D.L. like UGK
And then I told her

[Chorus]



Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life

I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

It's funny
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin', say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?

I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes

And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more
I can't
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money to death
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way

The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
Wise man say


I'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)

Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

You got the power to let power go?

I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go

You got the power to let power go?
(21st century schizoid man)


Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

Shake it up, up rock ya body
Make it knock, knock when you partyin'
Take a break, break in the audience
Do ya footwork break and stop again

I'm lookin' sharp, you can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin', I'm holdin' done that layaway rack
Aye, rhinestones all in they face, gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way

Gotta put these chickenheads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid, babes, ain't trippin', I juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block all the people say

Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

Aye yo this mothafucka jammin', I'm on it, it's a anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras
They gone have me on concrete, loot in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's

I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?

Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

Girls be so thirsty, thirsty, fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me whenever I hit the block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves

They be so grimy, nasty, bogus, turkey, germy, dirty
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick
(Naw)
Let the pioneer blast my shit, wait a minute, hold up

Bubble letters on my butt say 'Fresh'
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa, acrylic base top all gold
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold

Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'


I put on, I put on, I put on, I put on 
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city

When they see me off in traffic, they say "Jeezy on some other shit"
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, thats right I work for N.a.s.a
This 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

[Chorus: x2]
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
Put on (east side) Put on (south side) Put on (west side) Put on

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Half bag, top back,
Ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps,
You know I like it super sized
Passenger's a red-bone,
Her Weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery,
Imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus,
The realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die,
The realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli,
So I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one,
Comin' from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton,
Flyin' down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean,
On my way to Charlene

[Chorus: x2]

I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on
I let my nightmares go I put on,
Everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me
You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely
I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
Cause every night (every night) I put on

[Chorus: x2]

Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
Cause every night (every night)
Let me see what we have tonight 
I'm high as a satellite 
I see those flashin' lights


Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, oh you good?"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him


Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night, like she on patrol
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it

Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When did you become a robocop
No, I don't need a robocop

Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh oh

Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it

Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When you become a robocop
Somebody please make it stop

Stop, drop, roll, pop
Bitch, I'm cold,
Ain't use to being, told stop
So I can never be your Robot
Fast or slow
You can stay, you can go
Now that you know, now that you know
Yea I had her before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know
Soldiers don't ask me no more

Okay, okay, okay okay
You spoiled little LA girl, you're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me, you must be joking, or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me, haha that was a good one
You're first good one in a while, you need to stop it now, oh


I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in?
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma was in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we know where home is
And so instead of sendin' flowers, we the roses

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

It brings the sunshine, oh

I smile when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

I smile when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (say)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh uh
I won't wait, no


And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find
Yeah I always find
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Runaway from me baby

Crazy, just crazy
Runaway as fast as you can
Runaway from me baby
Runaway
Runaway from me baby
Runaway
Crazy
Why cant she just runaway
Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Twenty four seven, three sixty five
Pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your best move
You could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
Split and go where?
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know where I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can


Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah

I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow

My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Not visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand what you say
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath with my hand on the book
Tell the truth nothing but the whole truth
And you always give me half of you, half of you
Take half a shot
Don't you know my heart go, make you feel insulted though
My feet, oh fear fall feet

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife


Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake sleep isn't new

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
i pray you will

Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time she might leave soon

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will

Wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will

And your mothers saying "go to college"
So you finish college and its wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and crazing
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey now you'll get that  25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money
No more borrowing money from mom for my high
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level
Which is being a secretary's secretary!
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary 
Who never went to college
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart man
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, 
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"
I say "no, I don't know what it is, 
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".


You keep it going man, you keep those books rolling,
You pick up those books your going to read
And not remember and you roll man.

But I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school,
And these guys are out here making 
Money all these ways, and I'm spended mine to be smart.
You know why?
Because when I die, buddy, you know
What going to keep me warm, that right, those degrees

I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu wit' no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money, cops don't let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell em I said, "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said, 'Hell no'
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
But I don't, no matter how good it gets, it'll never be like for
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it's loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it's going down right now
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
Cause I know she's lookin' down right now

I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
Right now, right now, right now
I know you see me now right now

Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barney's
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, 32
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's somethin' that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

Now go get my throne cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone and I'ma make it hot 'til it's time to go
When it's time to go, where you trying to go?
You better act like you can see me now

Exactly, Rosewood
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D!

Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I loved her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Nah, nah, baby boy, you Jody, in the party, they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was lookin' like the old me
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Uh, ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like? 'Ye prot'g'
Nah, nah, he sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do


I'm cold
I'm cold
I'm cold
Yeah

I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is farewell

I got my life and its my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road

And that you know (that you know)
Tell every one that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)

Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind

And that's one thing that you know

The clouds is in my vision

Hollywood status with the shaded glasses 
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest 
Where the ladies got ass to sell alot sex 
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best 
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess 
And New York women are way too fresh 
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress 
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish 
Maybe I'm feelin myself too much I guess

And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies 
Get your own, I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get ?em a clone 
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes 
And everything you do is extra cold 
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece

If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased 
And this one here, is a heat rocks 
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks 
New version of Pete Rock!

What up Pam how your little man doin in New Jersey 
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried 
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland 
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it 
Shanice you're my piece from Compton 
Before I mark the plane make sure you cop them trees to spark up 
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail 
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel 
You lookin good in that one showin off your body 
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's 
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie 
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry 
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis? 
You so pretty hate to show off your titties for silly classes 
Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine 
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

[King Louie]
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Kanye West]
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Beenie Man]
Memories don't live like people do
They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have


[Max B:]
Yeezy, Yeezy, what's good?
It's your boy Max B, what's going on?
Just checking in on you
Appreciate the love and support
The wave is here
You a wavey dude anyway, so you already know
Ain't no problem, man, the game...
You already know how this game thing goes
Do your wave nigga
You got the official wave man
Just, just doing you...
Doing you, doing your wave
And keep it loopy, I know you're going to keep it loopy man
Shoutout, just shout you out
Hollering at you man, it's all love
I appreciate the... the energy
And we here, hit the town, we do something big
We gonna make a big tsunami up in the joint
You already know what it is, ahh

[French Montana:]
Silver Surfer
Silver Surfer in the flesh

[Max B:]
Silver surfer in the flesh

Ugh, wavey, baby, yeah

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the "No Smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride


Some people (Yeah)
Some people
Some people really are
Still dreaming (And as the sun sets
and the night falls)
They are still dreaming (and them hoes call)

[Kane West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out

How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out

Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out

[Chorus]
Some people really (still dreamin')
Some people really (make ya scream out)
Some people really are (still)
Still dreaming (st-still dreamin')
(O-o-o-o-one two one two
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true)
They are still dreaming
(O-o-o-o-one two one two
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true)

Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are

[Verse 2: Nas]
How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich?
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch

Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells

Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggaz to show you, how to come up wit' green
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen

Wit' little niggaz wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on

[Chorus]

Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools

And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
She worked for Fox News

One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it

Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards
Still dreamin'

[Chorus]


Let me know
Do I still got time to grow
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me

Seems like, street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the street lights, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination

But I'm just not there
In the streets
In the, streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like, street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination

But I'm just not there
In the streets
In the, streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fair


N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure:
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel homey, take six and take this, haters

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gonna do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And will do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya


And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right

They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't fall
To fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me
Did she forget what we once had

And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right get it right

Oh they got it all you can see they got it all
They got the cars the boat and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of y'all
He wants his kids and the dog
He wants his breakfast in bed
He's got his trust fund saved
Not a worry in his head
He's not you or me
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me

'Cause I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right get it right
Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right get it right

You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right get it right

Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right get it right

Intro: [Kanye West] (Lil Wayne)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
(Yeah)

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cuz you cut up my life
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooooh how'd you'd get there
Cuz we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Kanye West]
I got my life
And it's my only one
I got the night
I'm running from the sun
So good night
I made it out the door, door, door, door,door
After tonight
There will be no return
After tonight
I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And letting you know
LETTING YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Kanye West]
Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you cuz I'm just gon' be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And the night is young
The drinks is cold
The stars is out
I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know

[Chorus Kanye West]
Tell everybody, EVERYBODY that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cuz you cut up my life
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooooh how'd you'd get there
Cuz we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

Babygirl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it
And now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stank
but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you
With me no more
Now tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
THAT YOU KNOW
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

L-L-L-L-LETTING YOU KNOW
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW


My soul
I wanna take you to the glory  
Goal in my mind I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
Now where the south side?
Now where the west side? Yeah

Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again 
Dawg, are you fucking kidding?

My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch
With Donnatella Versace that's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think, Hennessey, I drink, I'm gone 
Off that Bacardi limon or Corona I'm zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade 
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwayne Wade and 'ay
Please don't start me 
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pot to barkers
From hood to parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up

I touched on everything
Married to the game Roc-a chain still the wedding ring 
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter 
On nights when 'Ye romance cameras flash so much 
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on award tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy, the hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy and, oh yeah, Yeezy 

I did it for the glory
The glory

What I'm supposed to do now man, the game all messed up 
How I'm supposed to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah, that tuxedo mighta been a little Guido 
But with my ego I could stand there in a speedo 
And be looked at like a fucking hero

The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night, the grind, the empty bottles of no doze
Tank on empty whippin my moma Volvo 
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The furrest-ur man, shit that you don't floss 
The Goyard so hard man I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that two door cost?
House in the Hills two doors from Tracee Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends, yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speedboats I admit, we rentin' 'em
When you meet me in person, what do you feel like?
I know, I know, I look better in real life

I hear people compare themselves to Big a lot
You know, Big and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to Big
Any one Big Pun, Big L or Notorious 
Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit 
Yeah, I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit

These haters be killing they self they wanna come and get the glory

Now where the south side?
Yeah
Now where the westside?
Yeah


Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me "don't touch me"
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said "I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said "Ye' you don't love me"
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly


Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you

I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
That are not A
's in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you

No Electro, no metro, a little retro, I perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo, Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out though is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sisters
They momma, named them after white bitches
No next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the Jewerly's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like "Is he gon' be dope again?"
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?
This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity

Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you

This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood
When I was back in my pajama shit
Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat
Will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop
Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips
Pink champel, Valentine L
Bally's on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like "where the Madonna's now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said "you raised that boy too fast,
But you was raising a warrior"
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us

Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up

It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay


Stutterin' givin' 'em rest and makin' love again
In my best I be the run again
And I have the man dem stutterin'

I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefin' just too long when
He see me in the evenin'
Want to catch all these feelin'
Well let me be the first to get mine

Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittin' and countin', smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling 'What up?'
The jeans cost 500 fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yellin' Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock I'm all machinery, 'ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo

I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefin' just too long when
He see me in the evenin'
Want to catch all these feelin'
Well let me be the first to get mine oh

I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryin' to see through the mist of it
Could have been livin' it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to, better your development,
Situation delicate

Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All 'cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You cluster fucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so its (Ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
Til' the sky calls or its flames on us, Push'!

I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefin' just too long when
He see me in the evenin'
Want to catch all these feelin'
Well let me be the first to get mine

2 Chainz, I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo,
Ammunition I'm pitchin' to make your body, switch another position

I hope the people is listening,
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
Its tickelin' when I hear what haters be whisperin'
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in? Huh,
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga? (You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga? (You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was frontin' aw man, made something from nothing)

I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would've been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheatin' I'd still've bought her more clothes
'Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore-you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallin' for, the clothes,
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontin'
God damn, we made something from nothing


You just popped in the Kanye West
"Get Right For The Summer" workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So first of all we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

One and two and three and four and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out, work it out now

Ooh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on sixteen bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies
We juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl
If you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
One and you brought two friends
OK, three more now hop in the Benz
Four door, do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out, work it out now

That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
'Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip, yeeuum!

Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on

Big Mike
Back at it
New Game
Kanye West

Yah, yah

I use the front when I write songs
Talking bout having eyes on
And I can bearly keep my lights on
And my beats so sick 
I should of got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic
I couldn't afford a debt

When the drop out dopped
I had to cop me a money tree
To funnel anybody who ever try to funnel me
With so much personality
What do you want from me
I could be by myself and enjoy the company

My life, this year, my carrer
It's the norm
Bet'cha its a war
Its for my lissit ford
94, I can only afford this accord
From the home of gang bangin
And we all that (Big Mike)

[Hook]
Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no draws?

[Verse 1]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
From the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!

[Bridge]
I'm flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Right around the time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I hadn't Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement

[Bridge]

Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, lemme ask this quest'

[Hook]

Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll muhfucking embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll muhfucking embarrass you
Hollerin' 'bout some hoes, I'll muhfuckin' embarrass you

You ain't gotta kick me out

But you still need to get your shit together girl

What do I do, what do I say
Gotta get us back to the way
That we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me

Five, six, seven, eight I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate

'Cause you still gotta get your shit together girl

What do I do, what do I say
Gotta get us back to the way
That we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me

You too much pressure doll
You gonna raise my cholesterol

Just to talk, just a thought
I'm gonna get a girl with a ass just as soft
Who swear man dolls like reservoir
And I was mister pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way, good way
Now we in the streets and I'm choking you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning box of Perez
Any girl I take out media take care of
I need a break now
Before I break now

Show me your Janet Jackson's if you nasty
You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson, classy
Why she say that ouch
Bitch, give me back my couch
And that same couch cashed in
Now listen to t-pain sing

Like one, two, three, four get the hell up out my door
Five, six, seven, eight I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, you can go to hell all I care, yeah
Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe

Now turn it up, turn it up (a little louder)
Turn it uup, turn it up (little louder)
Now turn it up (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
Now turn it up, turn it up

(Yeah) Yo, I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continuously get high
Instead of runnin 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get right
Show no respect can't live that way
You hold my check can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way
Our moves calculated through the lens, almost here
Success will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West (whut up, whut up!)
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets (everyday!)

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now, she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a sixth man
I'm in the club doin' the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin' the same ol' "Q" step
I have my money on my mind I was thinkin' green
She a pledge A.K.A. She was pink and green
I wanna a good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship's so hard it needs censorship
I'ma Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin one, the other's gettin' away
This way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

Go 'head, flip a coin so the game don't stop
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learnt before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came the park
But this industry'll play with yo' life man
They playin with yo' rent, food, water and lights man (yeah)
That's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' "Tidy T" jam
The battleram, then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run-D.M.C. Showed me how to walk, this way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

This way
This way
This way, ay
This way
This way
This way
This way, ay


I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt!
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
'Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dog, don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

Let me see you put your middle fingers up, to the world,
I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time (fingers up)

To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up, middle fingers up!

(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up
'Cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way,
Let's take it a notch up, take it up

Let me see you put your middle fingers up! To the world
I made up in my mind
Doin' things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me see you one more time (fingers up)

To the world, to the world, to the world
Mm' ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you, holy crap

Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up

I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me


I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop "lion" like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touch', Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!
Yeah, feels good to be home, baby!

One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"

Go get his rhyme like, should of been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, player hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"
Screaming, Jesus save me

The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
My God, two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free young bars, fresh men of the Roc

Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79th

We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need
Faith, more, safe, war


Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', finding
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster
Not havin' menages
I'm just being silly
I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the 'net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas, but yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence
Next she'll be off to college
And then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the light is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

I'm sayin' it like
I want a daughter like Nicki
Aww man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no menag's
I don't know how you saying it, but let 'em hear this


I knew I was gonna see ya, I knew I was gonna see you again!
I was gonna see you again
Where your god damn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil' book bag
Nobody want to see that
God damn fourth grader
Sit yo' ass down
Now he want to play it again like he got something else to do
You ain't got nothin' else to do
You ain't doing nothing wit yo life

Nothing with your life
What do you think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
You think this is easy don't you?
You think this is promised
Oh ain't nothin promised with you
Look at my face, do I got a promise face?
Does it look like promise you anything?
Kanye!
Nigga! Is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West! Mr. West

(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it

Somebody told me that delta's brownskinned, akas' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man
She said, "i know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin' but

(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can)
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can)

The night fallin' over brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine america without the slaves (the slaves)
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold booya cause she wouldn't protest it
'Cause, her best friends man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everyday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain
She yelled out "why you do this to black men? "

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' things ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinking big like lil wayne in the problem set

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
C'mon, tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our newports
Patriot act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny cochran dead, who gonna get us free now? 
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now? 
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and p's now? 
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile? 
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)


Oh yeah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stackin' money 'till it get sky high
(Kids, sing, kids, sing)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We don't care what people say

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed
Took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man
Man I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man you don't know, man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they ain't finna'
Say next summer I'm finna'
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is little Tre's scholarship
Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stackin' money 'till it get sky high
(Kids, sing, kids, sing)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We don't care what people say

The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she want to move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'till the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say
My niggas

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stackin' money 'till it get sky high
(Kids, sing, kids, sing)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We don't care what people say

You know the kids goin' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of em dyslexic
They favorite 50-Cent song 12 questions
We scream, rock, blows, weed, park
See now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Bad enough we on welfare
They trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm trying to get the car with the chromie wheels here
They trying to cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us
Fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say
My niggas

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stackin' money 'till it get sky high
(Kids, sing, kids, sing)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We don't care what people say


You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I want to fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

We major (come on, homie, we major)

Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
Ask the reverend was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want like wino's want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I want to fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I want to fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major


My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho

Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho

I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before

My god sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho

Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho

And I can't, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no I can't stop

Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
Oh ho
Oh oh ho


Man, you know I love you right?
You just got to be real with me
Is you cheating on me?

Nigga, there you go with that shit again
Baby, you know how I feel about you
I'm trying to make this work
My guys keeping coming to me
Telling me they seeing you and stuff
How this making me look? 
Buying you them rings
Them leathers; getting your hair done every week
Gotta let me know somethin'

Look, if you don't trust me
Why the fuck is you with me?
Coming at me on some Jay-Z shit
Who you with?
Calling my cell, leaving crazy voicemails
Figured you can get me if you called my girl, Nikki
But she was with me, and I was home at seven fifty
But that was when he got technical with it
Talkin 'bout he called my house at seven fifty-nine
I don't keep up with the time
What the fuck? 
You think I'm lyin'?
It all comes down to you trust me or you won't
The bottom line is you love me or you don't
And do you need me baby?

Yeah, you know I do
So you believe me, baby?
Yeah, for sure I do
Then he gave me a hug, jumped in the trunk, and went to work
He managed to leave without getting his feelings hurt
So I sat back, flamed up the weed, and thought up
Who the hell done run their mouth and almost got me caught up?

I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
He said: "But I don't usually."
I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
He said: "You know I don't usually"
I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
Look, you can't be tellin' people that you doin' me
You gotta keep this, here, between you and me

Look, I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around, you don't speak to me
When my girl be around, I see you peepin' me
When they both ain't around, you be freakin' me
We used to do it secretly
Now you all talk
You tellin' everybody like you want to get caught
I think my girl catchin' on 
'Cause my story keep changin' up
You gotta stop callin' up my crib and hangin' up
Truthfully, if you tellin' people that you doin' me
Then you tellin' me that you don't even want to screw with me
And that's a shame
I can't even do my thang
You get dick, and you go temporarily insane
You think it's a game, but I don't want to play no more
You want to stay, but you can't stay no more
You want to be with K, but that ain't okay no more
You got somethin' to say, but you ain't gotta say no more

I said: "Girl, don't you know what you do to me?"
She said: "But I don't usually."
I said: "Girl, don't you know what you do to me?"
She said: "You know I don't usually."
I said: "Girl, don't you know what you do to me?"
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
I'm a tell your ass now, baby, truthfully
I ain't told nobody that you doin' me

It seem like fine hos is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check, they ain't never where they're supposed to be
I learned my lesson; now I only fuck hos that's close to me
Don't get me wrong; you still gotta live close to me
This ain't a song I made for ugly hos to start approachin' me
You know how this go; I diss hos
I'm very mean now
My roley face green now
I bring your self esteem down

I knew since the day I met you if I would fuck you or not
So later on I asked my girl how many bitches you got
I never loved you a lot, but then this nigga got turned out
He told his boy that told his boy, and now the word's out
My man approachin' me with rumors that he heard about

But dude a lame
He probably asked you can he work it out?

I swear, y'all, betta keep the game on 'em
Yeah, y'all, now watch me change on 'em
Rule one: never tell your nigga who you fucked
And always smile back if he tell you he in love
Rule two: most men try to control you
Take my advice, 'cause it's so true what women go through
And rule three: you thinkin' he don't cheat and he committed?
He still get invitations from the last girl he been with
Bet his ho be mad; I bet she tell you that he hit it
Just check inside his pocket; find another bitches digits

I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
He said: "But I don't usually."
I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
He said: "You know I don't usually."
I said: "Boy, don't you know what you do to me?"
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
I'm a tell your ass now, baby, truthfully
I swear to God, baby, it should be you and me

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
These girls out here be thinkin' they caught up and shit
Fuck that; spend that nigga, yo; you know what I'm sayin'
You catch yourself up; you go to him
Let that nigga come to you with no type of evidence
You ain't got shit on you
I'm a do my thing
Word up, uh
Pimp on, baby


Just me and you girl
Whoa oh
Just me and you girl
Whoa oh

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

Just me and you girl
Whoa oh

We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi'a coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work baby?"
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."
On the phone, hollin' that "niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot

Just me and you girl
Whoa oh
Just me and you girl
Whoa oh


This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die I'm a fuckin' ball
Now who gon stop me?

No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need eight arms

Who gon stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you get me paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess it's on one basis
I only like green faces

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die I'm a fuckin' ball

Now who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?
Who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?

Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for

Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you

Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, beat the feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, six to six
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
See I'm thorough and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
Okay here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah

2 seats in the 911 uh, no limit on the black card ah
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM uh, to the ocean was my backyard eh
No lies in my verses hey, please pardon all the curses hey
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless uh
Middle finger to my old life ugh, special shout out to my old head uh
If it wasn't for your advice uh, a nigga would have been so dead uh
I'm living life, 'til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner, y'all can play me
For a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, 'cause I cook smart
Only thing that can stop me is me, and I'm a stop when the hook start, hold up

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'm a fuckin' ball

Now who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?
Who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?

Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for


Us living as we do upside down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher
Spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued

And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
Fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys

America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across her often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault

Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free doom

Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded 
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
In the mother country's crotch

What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?


Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there

Don't fire fight

Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you

I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found me, oh Jesus
I was too wild

And I need you now, lost and, found out, yeah

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"

Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah


I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't

They said, "Build your own," I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice," they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all!"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now
But she wouldn't leave

And I know you wouldn't

When somethings frees
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes you know, you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

And I know you wouldn't

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson but sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity (and I know you wouldn't)

I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)

For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (oh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say, "For better or for worse", huh?
For every damn female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you
And I know you wouldn't


You like to ride (uh)
(So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends"
(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride?
(I don't know what happened, it's just like, heh)
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me
'cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few G's
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda
Then I'ma take you to the house+ like +Trick and Trina+

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like West and Kanye
Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddammit I'm grown
Broke broad I'm a leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

I need you, I want you to
Come to me, ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You got a sister-in-law you'd smash? I got four of 'em
Damn, those is your sisters
You did somethin' unholy to them pictures
Damn, you need to be locked up
Nah, we need a bigger hot tub

Now let me see you back, back, back, back
Time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
She got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You remember bad bitches that you smashed? I recorded 'em
She said "fuck weed" 'cause she love X
If she suck seed, that's a success
If a girl cum, that's a fuck fest
And we gon' score 100 on this drug test

Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy (perfect!)

Fuckin' 'round whoop, scoop!
Whoopity whoop
Whoopity whoop, scoop poop woop toop
Scoopity whoop loot, looty-whoop-whoop
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy (uh, uh)

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
Han? Scoop!
You see them escorts? I escorted 'em, scooty-woot!
While y'all was trippin', I resorted 'em, whoop!
Then I kicked 'em out, I got bored of them, whoop!

Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

I know Obama was heaven sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be President
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk, though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas, then shit
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views as white supremacy, man 
We expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me"
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea, and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?


Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, huh?
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run, DMC, huh?
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh?
Turn TMZ to Smack DVD, huh?
Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa
Uh, told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it

Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye, fuck what they talk about
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, look, you had a shot at Ye
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You drop everything

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, haan?
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh?
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
That's why I fuck with Ye
See that was my third person
That's my bipolar shit, nigga what?
That's my superpower, nigga ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Ahhh!


Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh

It feels so good it should cost
Bought her alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, huh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross (uh, uh)
She seem to make me always feel like a boss (uh, uh)
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost (uh, uh)
She said I'm going too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh something wrong
Might need a intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh

Gettin' loose while I'm on the deuce, see me roll out
Watch you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty adventures for the evening, we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment oh oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, unless you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord won't hurt me, we all live in sin
Kids see ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
Now put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, now let your friends know

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh

Just do that and then let me the music do something, then do that again
That'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it
You know, three minutes max


Find my back
In the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm colder than the game, see 'em all strapped
And they can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me, 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God shine your love on me, save me please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long
Ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin' out nowhere
Where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, in the time I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God shine your love on me, save me please

Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher when the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, B
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environments
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord

Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)

Stay strong

Both sides lose somebody
Somebody dies, somebody goes to jail
woah, woah
Stay strong
Light on me, save me please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord, shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)

I love all your shit talkin'
I love all your shit talkin'

You ain't got nothin' better to do with yourself
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin' myself
I got new news to tell
Act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel
And only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' booch off the nail
Through with mixed-messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field
Little bit off for the real

It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through by the days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn't make
Watch the fakes
Leave 'em buzzin', thought they wasn't, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up


May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself 
He becomes the master of his environment

I don't, feel, pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
Scoop!
Nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

I'm so complete anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
I felt the chains on me locked in a cell
(You know I'm free, yeah) Ah!
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, that'll politic
Ooh, one day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin', "Fuck you"
I could never trust (free)

I feel free, I feel free

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
Yeah, nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Feeling out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm free
I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am free

I feel free, I feel free

Can't come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio

Don't wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain, getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe

Boy you move too quick just like a rabbit
Run the game like tortoise
Fuck her to the morning

I think I'm an alien
And got sent straight down from a portal (yeah)
Touch it from the back
And I swear that I won't record you (yah, yah)
Baby I'm not normal
Baby I'm not normal (no way)
They don't like us because we not normal
We can do anything and I won't bore you
It don't matter to you but you know I can afford you
You rock that Amethyst you know I can't ignore you
Watchin' Steven Universe, that's one hell of a story

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I could build your confidence as you build mine
You like me, I will love you always until the end of time
It seems like that I'm always on that thin line
Like 808s 
&
Heartbreak, Kanye with a little hentai
Samurai Jack on a journey, on my lonely, always rockin' V'tements
They asked me can I rap, man can I?
But I chose to be a sharp shooter like Chris Benoit
Drivin' in that Lamb, I remember when my mom took me to PennDOT
Fucked a girl from Sweden, then I sent her ass to Denmark
Fucked a girl from L.A., and I left her ass right there
Of course you rock with me 'cause I just came out this year
But I'ma see if you really fuck with me if you listening next year
Countin' all my bands up
Go 'head, throw your hands up
Throw your... yeah
Go 'head throw your hands up
Mad because their...
Mad because their only chance up
Yeah your only chance up
And I really did it
You know I really did it
Yeah I really did it

[Outro]
It's in a book
The B-I-B-L-E-


I woke up in the morning, brush my teeth smack my bitch ass
All I do is think about the cash
Yeah, what, getting all this cash
Yeah, what, I'm 200 on the dash
Lil Uzi ooh, I got hella groupies
Smoking Backwoods I don't fuck with doobies
Cuffed the double plus 'cause I'm rocking Ksubi's
I fuck with my same hoes I don't trust these niggas
990 that's the nubies ya
Smoked that boy like he is a loosie ya
On the Xan, hear a noise I load it up

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Driving around in a what
Saint Laurent all on my boots
Saint Laurent all on my boo
2000 dollar a tooth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
If you think they took my chain, boy you is a fool
I said boy you a fool
I just caught me a Mewtwo
I just caught me a Mewtwo (Mew)
Japanese girl stuck to me just like some glue

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Diamonds all on my teeth so I barely can talk
Money all in my pockets so I barely can walk
Diamonds they shine in the dark
She from LA but she live in New York
But I ain't worried about that
Worried about busting them traps
Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack
If she gon' leave then you know she coming right back
In a Cadillac do a drive by with a Mac
When I walk in none of these hoes can relax
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
Came right in put my city on my back
But I'm still so relaxed on a Xanax
I don't care what you did, don't love you less
But it's still Margiela all on my vest
What a cross on my neck
I just flew to the A
I might go to MIA
I ain't talking paper planes
On the block with all my chains
Got the money and the fame
You a lame that's a shame

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
(Hello) I was listening to this song
It goes like

I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new mans a lame
(Broke boy, broke boy, broke boy, broke boy)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans (oh get over it)

I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

See I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Compliment my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'mma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar

They know I'm the one so it's no way they can stop it
Tried to run off with the swag I put 'em in pocket
Told my main girl to stop it
She saw me up in a picture I thought they cropped it (oh my god)
Damn she think I popped it (oh my god)
I will not give these bitches this dick like no topping
Woah we're ending that topic
In the industry with Dickies all on my pop shit

I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie

Yeah the famous life it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side
Yeah the famous life it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side
Times up I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds they blind them
I can't fuck her she a minor
Times up I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds they blind them
I can't fuck her she a minor
Look for your bitch you can't find her
I was the one right behind her
Talking that shit you get tied up
Don't got enough get your grind up
The reason I got all these bitches and got all these diamonds, I can't make my mind up
Mind up, she gave me head, gave that mind up!

I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie

Take another pill for that magic

Give a fuck about what a source say

Most of these bitches ain't mine

Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Most of these bitches they ain't mine, nigga
You can have that bitch, I swear she ain't no dime, nigga
She no quarter, I won't spoil her
Think she Moses when she cross the water
Immigrant, she cross the border
How the fuck niggas say they can afford my bitches?
It's the same niggas rockin' Jordans
Pull up Trailblazer, like I'm in Portland
White boy shoot better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my niggas immortal
Sellin' fishes, I got Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with gators like I'm in Florida
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
Takin' that Pyrex pot and glass bowl
And stickin' my hand in that water
If the bitch try to take a quarter
It gon' be a homicide, Law and Order
It's cheaper to leave her
But it's gon' cost you some money if you wanna spoil her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wanna ride on top of my Sequoia

[Hook: Quavo]
Most of these bitches ain't mine

[Verse 2: Offset]
You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
I'm chasin' a nigga like Tom 
&
Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
The birds they be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers

[Hook: Quavo]
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'

[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
But it's all good though

[Hook: Takeoff]
When I come in with them M
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Ok I be on a private jet to Porteguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain't never seen
The OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes I make her panties leak
She still probably won't believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it's all good though

[Hook: Takeoff]

Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my god what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young nigga, ain't used to relations
So you know I ain't patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don't eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That's my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

[Verse 3: Offset]
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
I'm not used to cuffing the women but I'm gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]

[Hook: Quavo]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trapped out the bando, got tools like Rambo
Got bird like Birdman, got white like Lindsay Lohan
Made a hundred stacks off the pots and pans
On the corner serving grams, my niggas be on the block hard
My niggas be selling that hard, got bricks, like Shaq, at the free throw
You can call my phone, got them prices for the L-O, don't knock at my door, I don't wanna talk to you
Got them bricks for the low, I will serve you
In the bando, boarded up, got them bricks in the wall and in the floor
Pizzeria way I'm playin' with the dough
If the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know
Fuck twelve!

[Hook: Quavo]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows

[Verse 2: Offset]
Trapping in the vacant, serving all my patients
Get it from the Haitians, smoking loud my eye look Asian
Getting to the money, running to it, tryna chase it
Like it when she make it, cook it when she naked
Throw it in the microwave, Betty Crocker how I bake it
Trapping in the bando, big guns like commando
Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro

[Hook: Quavo]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
All new Camaro with the black and red interior
Migo gang taking over, yeah we is superior
Certified packs nigga you can check the serial
Foreign bad bitch and she say her name Trina
Traphouse look like it got hit by hurricane Katrina
These pounds bought a beamer, everything I do illegal
The bitches always wanna mingle, I'm stacking my money like pringles
Sipping on sprite and codeine, my foreign bitch Philippine
Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean
Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia, flipping the work with no spatula


Zaytoven

Yeah
Migos
Bars, bars, bars, 16 bars
16, 16
I don't know

You take the deuce of that yellow then drink it
I be like, 'Damn, boy what is you thinking?"
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I'm swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
Cause I still feel like people be after us (12!)
I got the chopper don't challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don't give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I'm sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it's recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that Regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that's a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I'ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don't drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don't imitate, the dab I create
I'm in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new Rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I'm on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don't beef with no rapper it's a money race
It won't be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray
Put a 'tato on the K
It gon' be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)
We straight!

Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table stacking a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It's a good day today, I'ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don't speak or say 'Hey'
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain't no trace
Don't come out the house, you can't make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I'm cashing out
Used to tell them folks 'Put your shit on layaway,'
When it's the summer, the spring, or the fall
Or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don't say nothing, Domingo gone get 'em
After you get 'em, Domingo gon' split 'em
Can't let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can't afford a fender bender
Now I'm fucking bitches and I'm Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain't gonna shoot it with 'em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain't talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain't gon' give 'em non'
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas, I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain't hearing none of that
All them niggas stick 'em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on 'em make a nigga do jumping jacks

(Offset!)
I'm slanging tree, like I'm the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I'm running, I'm not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Mohammed Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M
, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I'm a Nawfside lil' nigga, don't fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can't remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap 'em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deducing his crouch
Don't be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage 'em
Ready for war, 'case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset they start to go panic
They know I'm no bullshit, I'm ready to damage
I'm screaming out, 'Fuck it,' my cup is still muddy
Don't kick it with niggas, don't play 'buddy buddy'
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil' babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It's cheaper to leave her, I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra
Want to know anything about the bando, I'll teach you (Whatchu need?)

Shut down the whole city when I'm buyin' 'em

Make you bring the blocks out when I'm buyin' 'em

Bring a whole damn chicken, I want to buy it
Make 'em bring them whole blocks out and you bite 'em
Pockets on swole, I did it to the hundo breakin' that bowl
Got to buy 'em, when I buy 'em, get the bricks, I circumcise 'em
I got so many jewels on a nigga, I say l'chaim
Feelin' like the Koreans in Menace to Society
Tellin' them niggas to hurry and buy 'em

And if it ain't right I'm denyin' it
I'm 'bout the action, 'bout that violence
And no it ain't no rocket science
Get that pound and then you divide it
Weigh it up on the scale and count, slide it
Point 5 'em, I move in silence
I bought it, it wasn't an issue
Nigga I got 50 thousand dollars worth in tennis shoes
You gotta take an L if you want a fuckin' W
I started in a Super 8, I'm trappin' out the W
Mortal Kombat, fatality, I finish you
Niggas gonna hate on you, can you take the ridicule?
Got a hundred thousand dollars stashed up in the intertube
Got my bitches in the kitchen whippin' up a new

Need the whole thing when I'm buyin' 'em
Run and copped the whole bundle when I'm buyin' 'em
I'ma need a whole hundred when I'm buyin' 'em

[Intro: Offset]
I came out of jail to about 300 thousand. Gadgets on my whip, I'm lookin' at this mothafucka like how the fuck am I supposed to start this shit, man? (Yeah) Rich Nigga Timeline. (I know you can't believe this shit.) Unbelievable. (We did it.) Nah, forreal

[Hook: Quavo]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the fire
Stand up and bust with the fire

[Hook: Quavo]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I can't believe it, how I got these bitches
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina, Indonesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter

[Hook: Quavo]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

[Verse 3: Offset]
Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!

[Hook: Quavo]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

Fancy
I ain't got no time if you fancy
Frantic
I used to have J's going frantic
Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

I took a whole lot of chances
Reminiscing in my mansion
Thinking back then in the bando I put the dope in her panties
Remember back then on the North side 50 bands in the suitcase
Free my big brother Kobe
That's the only nigga that threw me the 10k
We were so hot we could sizzle
Now I'm so cold like a blizzard
You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them
I do this shit for my dawgs
We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball
Now we fuck hoes and ball
You don't understand it
I took all these chances
That's why I move all my niggas to my fucking mansion
We came up from nothing jugg a cutie smokin' onion
We came a long way from the bando smelling like funyuns
(Gone)

Chances
I done took a whole lotta chances
Romantic
I fuck her, I ain't tryna be romantic
Dancing
I just left the jeweler diamonds dancing
Damage
Try to take it my chopper do damage

Frantic

Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

Advancement
Money keep coming on in, Imma buy me an Aston
Outstanding
Look at my diamonds they dancing
Give me compliments on my fashion
Cum on her face on her lashes
Kick that bitch out of my mansion
Them choppers come then it get drastic
Got your gat then we turn you to ashes
I'm getting money, my kids gotta eat
Spend 50 thousand on my watch, it ain't cheap
You couldn't walk a mile in my motherfucking feet
Wanna get out so I took the damn plea
I took a chance
You told on your man
Got a bitch up in France
Call my phone when she land
She in love with my cash
Treat that bitch like a nat
Send my shooters attack
I can never go back
Act a fool with the gat
Christian Louboutin don't match
Grab the 40 blow your hat
But don't nobody know bout that
(Hold that down)

Chances
I done took a whole lotta chances
Romantic
I fuck her, I ain't tryna be romantic
Dancing
I just left the jeweler diamonds dancing
Damage
Try to take it my chopper do damage
Panic
Hold that dope down lil bitch bae don't panic
Fancy
I ain't got no time if you fancy
Frantic
I used to have J's going frantic
Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

Take a look at my life you spazzing
I'm the one that told them bout the fashion
Dabbin cup nasty that plastic you can have it
Block on fire like a dragon
No question when police be asking
Not having nigga you fasting
I do this rap shit with passion
Young nigga taking them chances
Running with plays like I'm calling Madden
Remember when I wasn't havin'
Like I got it I call that shit below average
Now I make a movie Great Gatsby
Remember they didn't want to call me
Takeoff (?)
Now look at them, got them embarrassed
Chances, only got one shot gotta get to the top
And niggas can't stand it
Your bitches gone still drop they panties
All the advances when you get chances
Panic, my pinky ring it do damage
Smell like a (?) on campus
They hated us so they banned us

Chances
I done took a whole lotta chances
Romantic
I fuck her, I ain't tryna be romantic
Dancing
I just left the jeweler diamonds dancing
Damage
Try to take it my chopper do damage
Panic
Hold that dope down lil bitch bae don't panic
Fancy
I ain't got no time if you fancy
Frantic
I used to have J's going frantic
Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

[Hook]
Black shades, Johnny Cage, diamonds go parade (Chirp! Chirp!)
Motorola in the kitchen, whippin' Sonya
My plug look like Pacquiao, his daughter is Kitana
Young rich nigga, getting money in Tijuana
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Sellin' that dope to the leems and lames, I pull up and I'm in your lane
That droptop that Audi insane, karate that chop on my brain
Got a main bitch, no name
My main plug, name Fang
He choppin' them bricks and remixin' them chickens
He front me the work, now I got a ticket
My plug came from China, my diamonds Albino
I got the birds singing like I'm Richie Lionel, I mean Lionel Richie
Finessing the plug, again I did it, my bitches exquisite
My life is expensive, you flexing the rental
Erasing the work, like a #2 pencil
Hoes with me, on the left and the right
I'm feeling like Malcolm, I'm stuck in the middle
You a rat in the hood, Stuart Little
I'm blowing on gas like a fiddle
Young nigga in the hood selling nickels, white boys keep the ice Popsicles
Flip the work, like a acrobat, doing jumping jacks
J's sniff the work off the plate, had a heart attack

[Hook]
Black shades, Johnny Cage, diamonds go parade(Chirp! Chirp!)
Motorola in the kitchen, whippin' Sonya
My plug look like Pacquiao, his daughter is Kitana
Young rich nigga, getting money in Tijuana
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Whippin' the coca, no cola
You want it, just hit me on my Motorola
My diamonds are yellow corona, I'm selling that Princess Fiona
I'm smoking that gas with Obama
I pull up in Zondas, you pull up in Hondas
I laugh at you clowns, Ronald Mcdonald, choppin' a ton of Osama
Mr. Miyagi my plug, I make all the profit, for checkin' his nasi
I'm feeling like Christopher Wallace, Versace, Versace, Versace
All these damn plugs, and young Takeoff I'm the socket
Beat that pot, Bernard Hopkins, I got flavor Baskin-Robbins
I'm fuckin' Kitana, you know I got Sonya, for days
My diamonds they kick Johnny Cage, Quentin Jackson Rampage
Plug out in China Town, hit my cell and said he got that shrimp fried rice
He drop the prices by the pound in China Town

[Hook]
Black shades, Johnny Cage, diamonds go parade(Chirp! Chirp!)
Motorola in the kitchen, whippin' Sonya
My plug look like Pacquiao, his daughter is Kitana
Young rich nigga, getting money in Tijuana
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town


It's a brand new day, plus the birds out here chirpin'

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?)

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?)

It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin
But really I'm trippin
Only wear Ballys when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, That Lidnsey
Like I'm a chemist, treat 'em like dentist
You showing your benjis on instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you 'cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it
It hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wan' come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack
So my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip
And a brand new .45 sittin. on my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?)

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga (Hol' up hol' up)
It's a brand new nigga on the block
Hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock 'em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80's
They cookin', they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'm a rapper
My pot too big, got too much water
So I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack,
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make a tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now
Putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient,
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I'm movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker
Molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker.

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?)

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but you ain't never ever workin
(Got work but you ain't never ever workin!)
Throwin money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin
(Why you playin' when you know yo' pockets hurtin'?


They said it was called the trap
But on the north side we call it the bando
Yeen' know
Naw for real

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando
We the first ones that came up with the bando
Talking 'bout you got the Act but what they goin' for
I'm bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure
I been teaching niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

Ta-Ta-Takeoff
All rose gold on, call it Rose Bowl
I got the key and the game on lock like a cheat code
Fuck a bad bitch, I'm fucking with the fleek hoes
And I'd never give my soul up for a bankroll
Niggas get lucky standing right there by the rainbow
No rain though, I'm in the Yung Rich Nation raincoat
Good aim though, that red dot right up at your Kangol
Looking in my DM and I see your main ho
You know we the ones that came up with the bando
Them boys talking 'bout the boards on the windows
When you trapping keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, 12!, running out the back door
The ring on my pinky is bigger than a globe
Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold
Piping up in front of your bitch, you get elbowed
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, it's your theme song
So many pints in my crib, it's a lean home
I'm so high I just need a wall to lean on
Phone home, get so stoned when we gone
Cookie smoking, the ozone, rich snowcone
Mink, it cost five, I leave the coat on
Bitch time to get your roll on
Clap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on
Hold on

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando
We the first ones that came up with the bando
Talking 'bout you got the Act but what they goin' for
I'm bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure
I been teaching niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

Offset!
Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad
Walk up in the Mansion, I just made a money pilin'
Trappin' out the bando, selling crack up in the alley
I sent my young niggas, I got Foo with the tool
Contemplating should I drop a four or drop a deuce
Heard you a real slick looking for a good lick
But my niggas ain't going for the bullshit
I got the stick, nigga don't trip
Nigga run up in your house and tying up your bitch
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits
J's at the bando in the morning, got to fix
I'm sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible
Make her take a physical like medical
Fucking bitches over, she like it's a miracle
You niggas don't even know I got some pain in me
Missing my grandma, wish she could sing to me
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in me
When I'm pulling up I drop the brain on it
Came in the game with the fashion statement
We dropped Versace, the fame it came quick
Got to stay focused, consistent, don't quit
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando
We the first ones that came up with the bando
Talking 'bout you got the Act but what they goin' for
I'm bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure
I been teaching niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

Quavo
The way they took a nigga's dab I want to smack a nigga
Knock a nigga's lights out, uncle whack a nigga
These niggas made out of plastic like a action figure
I can't kick it with your bitch, I ain't no Falcon's kicker
Young nigga in the hood eating Honey-sicles
I'ma send your ho a text with the purple pickle
Nigga I ain't gotta flex, I'm a real nigga
I know niggas in the bando still trapping nickles
Pop a perc, you think I'm Marshawn eating Skittles
Everybody still comparing Migos to the Beatles
Who the fuck you think you scaring with that lil Nina?
Call my niggas and they pulling up like Al-Qaeda
Damn I mean Al-Qaeda, spray 'em like a firefighter
For fucking with the albino, feeling like Mekhi Phifer
Niggas having ghostwriters, stripes like I'm Tony Tiger
Migo gang the three igniters, then they try to doubt us
I know you remember the titans
I know we got the touch like we work for Midas
Light my cookie with the purple in it like the Vikings
Came from a long road, you the one that starts hitchhiking
I pour a glass of water 'cause you wanna pop a Vicodin
I open up the door, she said damn my mans you're frightening
Spikes on my shoe, yeah I'm Christian Lou, Mike-ing it
Where's Quavo? Bitch I'm in another continent


Ah ah ah its your boy Bobby Shmurda aka I think that I'm Tom Cruise man
Straight out the motherfuckin tombs, man ah ah ah
Free all my real niggas, ya heard, SHMIGO!

Shmigo!
Free my nigga Bobby man
Free my nigga Rowdy man
Huh, Shmigo Gang
Dabbing in Maison Margiela
Get popped like a kettle, hit you in your cerebellum
I'm seeing stars in my Panamera
We went through the pain, but we never let up
Yellow Corvette mustard, Lambo red ketchup
Millionaire nigga I'm a walking vegetable
These niggas be biting and I'm getting fed up
Got your bitch at the condo with both of her legs up
These niggas be talking about how computers with a gun emoji
Now he think he a shooter
Eating Benihana, take a trip to Punta Cana
Fuck it, I might land in Bermuda
Thirty thirty, I got thirty rounds
The shotty make a nigga lose pounds
Harriet Tubman, money underground
You niggas is sick and we got the crown
Diamonds and pearls for my girl
It's a man's world, I feel like James Brown
Smoking power at the Trump tower
Nigga gassing, laughing, watching Richard Pryor
Fuck a job I don't get paid by the hour
Can't be from the block, I heard you a coward
When you got money it come with the power
I am the supplier, grip money like pliers
Stay with my Glock 40 its extended
Can't wait to pull it, trigger finger itching
Fork in the pot, lets go fishing
My momma always told me don't be trusting bitches
Hit em with it, hit em with it, hit em with it
Look at these diamonds like Sonny Liston
Migos fighting in the crowd
Looking like Ron Artest verses the Pistons

Quavo!
Free my nigga Bobby Bitch
Hoes in the lobby bitch
At the age of 17, I hit my first lick
Twelve coming hit the fence you better jump the ditch
You don't wanna get caught with the dirty stick
Told that bitch to suck my dick, I don't want no kiss
When I got my first M, I bust down my wrist
When I got my first sem, I emptied the clip
Bad bitch fuck with a bad boy call her Lil Kim
Hakeem Olajuwon, above the rim
When I go to DC (Pow) I thought it was him
Then I land in Bahamas, order up some shrimp
The plug wanna meet up in Bahamas, told him make it quick
The money keep calling, tell it come in
Free Shmigo Gang, Bobby and Free Rowdy

Ah ah ah ho, it's ya boy Rowdy man
Shmigos ATL man, Shmigo Gang man
Ah ah ah ho, Yea yea yea Rowdy


Everywhere I go
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)
I just left the plug
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them Falcons and them Ravens 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up

I whip it like slavery, my trap full of babies
Lil' mama she hate me, she say that I'm changing
I tell her I made it, the only thing changed
Is the money I'm making and the pamper on these babies
I'm whipping and whipping, these pigeons and chickens
These birds they flying from city to city
I'm pouring up Actavis, dranking and sipping
The color is purple, I'm drinking on Ceely
The Bentley, the Benjis, these bitches they sucking like babies
On the nip of them titties, like VIC get silly
You talking bout 100 band juugs, young nigga you know that I'm with it
I pull up, I'm serving your city
I'm serving ODs, I got it from Mickey

Everywhere I go
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)
I just left the plug
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them Falcons and them Ravens 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up

I'm cooking and whipping up pies, with no eyes
I'm cooking them burgers and fries
I'm a master in disguise
Mama she told me I'm wise
Looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii
I'm chopping on bricks circumcised
My bitch, she came from Dubai
She got that good brain like Devry
I'm smoking and leaning and driving
I hope I don't get DUI
Watch out for the snake and the lies
I'm trapping and whipping cream pies
My wrists is like water come dive
The streets is a jungle you gotta survive

Everywhere I go
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)
I just left the plug
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Got them Falcons and them Ravens 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up

It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin' (ba-bow)
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget (nah, for real)
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? (Shit)
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check (do it)
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewellery, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M
, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged, get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country


Fuck it, crown the king
You dig?
You know know what I mean?
Fuck it, crown the king
Benz truck for the queen
G.I.A, my rings
G.I. Joe, my team
Fuck what you mean
Fuck what you mean
Talking too cheap
Like money ain't green

Nigga look like we'll, nigga look like we'll shoot at 'em
Niggas look like we'll sponsor the dope and you sell 'em
Nigga look like you'd snitch on a nigga, yeah, you tell 'em
Nigga might think we UPS the way we mail 'em

Dunking a ball like I'm Kemp
Slangin' the tree like a chimp
Shot at me, walk with a limp
Niggas so don't attempt
Ice on change the temp
Northside bangin' them
Don't let strangers in
Twist your fingers in
Gangster shit begin
Used to get in and kickin' the doors and now I want the back end
Used to sleep on mattress floors, fuckin' a bitch and her friend
Wake 'em up, get in a taxi hoe and then my day begin

I, I, count the guap (count, count)
Set up shop (oh, oh), fuck the cops (fuck 12)
We ain't worried (not at all)
Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like McFlurry's (oh lord)
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin'

Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (hey)
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (whoo)
Put on the Patek, to change up the weather
The shit turning into the rain (rain)
Put on the Patek, to change up the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, to change up the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (hey)
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (whoo)
Put on the Patek, to change up the weather
The shit turning into the rain (rain)
Put on the Patek, to change up the weather
The shit turning into the rain

Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don't need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense

[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Juug, Finesse, Steal
I gotta have a mil
I was raised on the hill like Jack and the Jill
Do anything just to pay them bills
My brother caught 15 waiting for the pill
When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don't give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Plug's like a socket, gotta keep the rocket
Tryna get a profit, running to that money like Sonic
All my cars robotic
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" gone

[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Finessing and flexing like Wrestlers
Indian plug in that castle
Bald headed Jag, got cancer
Turn your main bitch to a dirty dancer
I'm cooking and wrapping them chickens
Finessing these niggas on tickets
If I fuck with ya, I'mma give you a straight drop
If its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My shoes is Prada's or Bally's
Finessing since I can remember
My wrist so cold, December
I'm selling T-bones, they tender
That steel wrapped around me like Bender
Difference between me and you
I'm real and you a pretender

[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser

[Intro]
Call Rell Money, tell 'em bout money nothin but 100's

Bow bow prow, that's them hollow tips as they comin

Woo woo, fuck Gwinnett County

Aye throw that shit, throw that shit 12 outside
Hurry up man, hurry up man

[Hook x2: Takeoff]
It's a narc at my front door

Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando

[Verse: Takeoff]
It's a narc on my front door
They looking for Takeoff, they heard on the streets I be selling that blow (who?)
It's a pot on a stove
Up in a bowl, 100 blunts rolled (gas)
I hit the back door
Me and Quavo meet Offset at the store
Call real money, talking bout money
Nothing but hunnids
That's the sound of them mocking birds as they humming
That's them hollow tips as they coming
Pull up, I skirt in the Audi
Hit 200 on the highway
Skip going crazy in Mazzie
Driving like a nigga caught a body
Next day pull up in the Rari

My white boy he told me I'm gnarly

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Man fuck, my mama hit my phone

Might flush that work
Skip 'bout to dip, he running with a zip
It's 100 on 'em, made a quick trip
Make a U-Turn, get outta here
Too-too many snakes in the grass, man somebody telling
Here go 10 bands skip, get his cerebellum
What you mean hand you the pistol? Here the Mac-11
It's six o'clock right now, I want the nigga dead at 7
Got off the phone with Gucci, he told us we on the news
We all over the channels, 4, 5, 11, and 2
He said, "Be safe lil' bruh, just hit me when you need some money"
We taking G-4 private plane, we 'bout to leave the country

[Hook]

[Outro]


Would you ooh
Would you ooh

Hey, I know this might sound weird to say
But would you love me if I ran away? (away)
I know you probably think I'm insane
Ain't nothin' change but the pocket change ( pocket change)
I know they gotta feel my pain (feel it)
I make them birds Lauren Hill sang (brr)
And everywhere I go they know my name (and what you claim)

'Cause I be reppin' gang gang (gang gang)
Posted with the gang gang (gang gang)

Big body rolls it be hoggin' up both lanes
She lift her nose up when she want that cocaine
I lift my doors up the 'Lambo take propane
After my show we put hoes in the chokehold
At the door, we take cell phones no photos
Money comin' in too much I can't hold, truckload

Pulls strings like a banjo (banjo)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Guwop in this bitch and I got shooters too
Snatch all the clothes out the mall like the looters do
And all my bitches got them racks, got a Hooters crew
My rims are gorgeous, riding on forgies big as hula hoops
Fuck the prosecution, I find a revolution
Sell white Rolls Royces with focals, inspired it on constitution
Whipping up babies that child abuse

And 12 rottweilers that I feed gunpowder
They bite, don't bark or growl at you
These young niggas'll torture you, cartel will be proud of me

Crossing my line, I'm dropping that dime right on your mind
Hit him in the spine

Fuck nigga where is the Benjamins at?

Pull up on your block K right next to the speaker
I got the falcons, the seagulls, the eagles
Paper soldiers like I'm Beanie Sigel
You can fuck with that nigga but my dope is cleaner
You can shop with him but my price is cheaper
You don't want me to go get my young niggas

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Bitch ride like six pack, break her like Kit-Kat
Ho fuck around, get kidnapped
Drown the bricks in the water, take a bird bath
All white diamonds like RiFF RAFF
Trap! Flippin' and breaking the packs, I got the catch in the back
Migo Jerz got the gas, no petrol, made a million dollars on the metro
Giving them hell, DJ Durel, watch the dope on the scale
Sippin' the lean, moving like snails, but I'm still wrappin' the bales belts
Clientele, clientele, bitch I've been running from twelve
Shipping the pounds in the mail, Migo Gang label cartel

[Verse 2: Offset]
Meet me in the bando, flippin' bricks like it's a sandal
Got a chopper, and it's camo, monkey nuts, a lot of ammo

Rolex my wrist blow a kiss, I might take your bitch for a hit
Look at my bitch, she British, Australian gator my fit
And when the pack in the town, we baggin' them up in them grounds

Married to the money, took a vow

I'm twistin' the rock like I'm Rocsi
She sweatin' like she ran a mile, she soakin' wet she need a towel
She suckin' her lip, bitin' down
She moanin' and makin' them sounds
She came while she suckin' me now
I'm lookin' at her like damn
Hannah makin' them go bananas
She fuckin' and suckin' on camera
Pop a Hannah, she got stamina
My jag, still a Panorama
I'm beatin' the pussy like Michael, I call her Dirty Diana

[Hook]
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white

Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white

Yo bitch lookin' like she want to fuck some'

When a nigga hit the plug, when a nigga hit the trap and I hit em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh (Skkrt)

You niggas in your own lane, Migo gang in a division
Hit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it's missing
Hit the pot, hit it hit it hit it, make 'em take that like Diddy
Fuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions
Look up the statistics, I'm worth a milli
I might pull up in the coupe and hurt your feelings
If you shooting at a nigga, better hit him
'Cause you never know, he could come back and hit you

Your bitch lookin' like she want to fuck some
That's what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)

Bullets hit the Sprinter, you sweeter than a cinnamon
I'm checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine
All enough I pay my dividends, Migos I'm a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit 'em with the tackle, pull out the chopper, not fronting I'll rush em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I'm rocking Margiella's
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I'm riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug too far so I tell a nigga mail 'em

Yo bitch lookin' like she want to fuck some'
That's what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)

Nigga talking crazy like he want to buck
Hit him with the uppercut, I make 'em knuckle up
Pull up in the Lamborghini, muscle like I'm tough
Make your bitch buckle up, turn me up
Sipping on poison ivy, nigga take my double cup
My brothers no Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck
Nigga talking bout a check then Imma run it up
Shots fired at my Sprinter bus, bap bap bap, grrr
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
For dolla, cold chopped, and they pulling up
Pick up the vent, then I point it up
Start busting, there ain't no need to load it
I hit the gas tank on they Expedition truck

Yo bitch lookin' like she want to fuck some'
That's what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug, when a nigga hit the trap and I hit em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh (Skkrt)

[Intro]
All this time
All them niggas we done tried them
We done tried to warn 'em
All these other labels we done tried to warn 'em
All these fuck niggas we done tried to warn 'em

[Bridge]
They ain't wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain't wanna let a nigga in
They ain't wanna let a nigga in
They ain't wanna let a nigga in

[Hook: Quavo]
They ain't wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain't wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain't wanna see a nigga win
So we had to kick the door down
They ain't wanna see a nigga win
Better let us in or we gon' kick the door down

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Better let us in or we gon' kick this door down
Got heavy artillery, Glock 9's, SK's (What else? Hundred rounds!)
I'm lookin' around, I'm lining 'em up, yo artist is takin' the sound
The industry won't let us in, fuck it, kick the door down
I told 'em that day would come, now we on top
Look at them, watch how they run try to get they spot
They wanna be kin, they wanna be friends, they tryna get in
You think that day I don't remember you? You don't let us in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Losie]
They ain't wanna see a nigga in
We independent and we countin' Benjamins
The rap game got no friends
Nigga fight, nigga pretend
Nigga act like yo man
Nigga won't even give you a hand
Nigga talk behind yo back
Won't happen if you ain't got a sack
This a true story real facts
Make the whole world roger that
And QC fuck ?
Hunned bands, watch them fat
We done ran up a check
In the rap game I sit back

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
All the hoes wasn't fuckin' with me back then
But all the bitches wanna fuck Young Guapo now
Ten promoters at my fuckin back end
Got a pint of lean whenever Guapo fly in town
Motherfuck the rap game and industry
The streets they taught me never show no sympathy
I swear I never thought I'd be on MTV
Them M
the only thing that interest me
I know why they envy me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: MPA Duke]
Back then they wasn't fuckin' with me
Now they can't get enough of me
Now the cameras out and they flashin'
Paparazzi takin' pictures
Young independent niggas ballin like the major league
I think they done caught a disease
I'm allergic to brokanese
Young nigga came from the bottom
To the top I had to grind
I was on the block fore the sunrise
So a young nigga like me had to shine
Came a long way from bustin' bands and servin' Ziploc
Solid foundation, QC the label
We hangin' above the label

[Hook]

Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga just was cooking, that's the reason why the stove hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank roll knot

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
You better move, move it
You better move, you better move, move it
You got to move (get out), you got to move (move)
You got to move (move), you got to move!

I'm a criminal, I got to move my operation
You don't got the money on time, my nigga what's your occupation
I played em with the muslim, we came up with the [?]
We would never be in cases, never in investigations
Told em As-salamu alaykum cause my niggas kept it sacred
I'm feeling like Big Meech I got a hundred million in my vases
I got GD in my vessel, pistol popping like it's kettle
I can make 100 thousand dollars with no effort
Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
Imma put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping active, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don't need to count it
You a cannibal, run off with the pack, eat em like animals
Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole
I know how to move em, Michael Jackson, I'm a smooth criminal

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
You better move, move it
You better move, you better move, move it
You got to move (get out), you got to move (move)
You got to move (move), you got to move!

Drinking on Activis, whip the work then I'm packing it
100K in the attic, I got the bricks in the cabinet
Though the work is immaculate, I be trapping and dabbing it
On the island I'm cooling it, had the kush in my Loubotins
That's an intruder in the window, I'm shooting, fly to Bermuda
Pull up with choppers with the coolers in it
I'm trapping, got a half a bag but don't know what to do with it
Fuck a milli, bet a thou'll make your bitch get loose with it
Selling out arenas, fuck a nigga's city up, we used to it
They never seen 100 thousand cause you niggas new to it
QC that's the label got a solid foundation
My nigga trapping out vacants, we smoking gas like Jamaica
Black and white Bentley Musalnne but I am not racist
Traveling around the world to go get Benjamin faces
If you ain't talking bout money then I get aggravated
Get up out my face if you ain't talking Benji Franklins
Taking trips across the nation

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
You better move, move it
You better move, you better move, move it
You got to move (get out), you got to move (move)
You got to move (move), you got to move!

Chain for the gang, ain't bought this shit (gangbang)
Everybody 'round me selling cold bricks (freeze)

I don't want you to fire with no clip
Thirty plus a .45 on my wrist

Livin' life, wanna vibe with my bitch

Giving back to the face of the planet
Then I bust down a chain with a 'nana (bust down)

Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)

My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Get this bitch ass nigga off of from 'round me, Naw forreal
I had the plug with the molly and the xans in a marijuana field
Want to live the Migo life? It's hard to live
Want to walk in my shoes? That is hard to fill
Naw forreal, man you know that we made a mil'
Independent, I cease and desist your deal
You niggas trippin' cause you out of business
And we came in the game so fast, we're professionals
Started doin' shows at Mansion and Obsessions
You seen it, everybody know, they witnessed
Naw forreal, R.I.P. my nigga Pistol P
I know he send a nigga down blessings
Now I wanna walk around on the north
Nigga gotta keep the mac chicken

[Verse 2: Offset]
Naw forreal, really had to sit down and do some time
Naw forreal, young rich nigga got rich off of a halftime
The block be beatin' like Alpine, nah forreal, 200 for the Act line
Stand at the stove, whip a slab, that's a cookie slab
Police tried to get me for a gang, I had an alibi
Nah, fuck niggas you a lie
Rel hit a jug Willie Mac found a nine
Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth just like a Altoids
Chopper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet
We ain't holdin' no lean, go ahead and pour it
Skinny tires on the rari' lookin' bow legged
I'm a bachelor, I live in a mansion that's gated
44 to say bow!

[Hook: Quavo]
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Naw forreal, pints double sealed
And the OG gas bag come vacuum sealed
Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
And the door stickin' out at my grandma crib
Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was prayin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems
It's a lot of shit that I regret I did
Can't let negativity get to me
I take a private jet to Sicily
So you the grinch who stole Christmas
I got the OG gas bag Christmas tree

[Hook: Quavo]
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)

Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)

It's just another day on the North side
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the North side
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the North side, it's just another day on the North side
On the North, it's just another day on the North side

Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the second, I go with the hard
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
Up in the game
Look at my house, take a long at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day

And I took me a flight to the Everglades

What a beautiful day, my AKK recouped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the North side rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac ala zone (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jug and the car belt was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Doing the candy patrolling

Wake up in the morning, gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound

Chucking no gloves, drive [?]
We headed to ground, we here to do time
Killing the door a million times
My nigga [?] he had to do fire
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no regular ball
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you really a tard
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Needed college, I didn't go to clock
Beating the pot like it's martial arts

Wake up in the morning, gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the North side
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga

Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Plan a trip to Peru, charter jet, me and you
You going out your way, way out your way
So I had to do this for you
Jackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo
It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
If she going our way, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch, or act brand new
You go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

You always dropping off your flav
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah

But you had my back from the other me
She bending over, back for me
Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets starting to let off

Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all

I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
'Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don't mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don't mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that's what applied to me (I'm geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys
I give her phone down the street

Eat it up busy bees
Stevie Wonder, play with keys
I told my plug, 'Yadda mean'
That mean, 'Come on, with them things'
I put the work 'cross seas
Feel like I play with Kareem
I walk around with the nin'
Hundred thousand for the team
I woke up 'cause I had a dream
I shot a nigga in the spleen
Two niggas looking like Kel and Ken'
Your favorite cousin, dope fiends
I was going on a mission
But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain't here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I'm trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send 'em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc' that's the starter pack
Go to the jeweler want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can't get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain't own it, where you rent it at?
If it ain't broke I ain't fixing that
I put the dope in the trunk
I put the extras in the kitty-cat

I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
'Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)

She said she want to kick it on the bus
Fucking and sucking up all of us
You know how we do, we just slaughtered her
My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches boujee, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I'm grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug, I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running 'round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers, you a roody-poo
YRN 2, Baller Alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it's a brew

Quavo, Call up plug he in Tokyo
Place your order, need a bird pronto
I got that Juliet ain't talking Romeo
All my goons we wild boys ain't talking bout Steve-O
All the hoes they bad, cause this money on the floor
They wanna go, pronto
Tell her to put the molly on her tongue and nose
Lets ride
Yeah we going to Northside
Migo gang till I die
Fuck 12, the FBI

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Started from a brick now I'm in a condo
Happen so fast, ASAP, Pronto
Ain't really worried bout shit no more
Running to the money like Usain Bolt
Sipping on the lean, Now I'm in slow-mo
Meeting wit the plug just to get the pesos
Can't even wait, gotta go in get the the cake
Cause momma told me to put the food on the plate
No delay, I need it andal'
Gone just pay for the goons start to spray
Ain't really trying take the shit that far
Smoking on the gas that nigga on Mars
Hurricane wrist got a nigga sea sick
Paid in Full but my name ain't Mich
And the trap got gas, and the trap got brick
ASAP, Pronto, man a nigga got rich

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I'm going in, no needles
I got stripes, no Adidas
I got juice, no beetles
Bells in the trunk, fuck carrying a visa
My Spanish plug Eduardo, his cousin El Chapo
They keep that coco
If I need that 2 doe, I call up Pedro
Barbados where I get that yayo
Say you need that pronto, I'mma call El Sancho
Free big bruh West side, The OG the head honcho
Tell the judge, ASAP, right now, Like pronto
Trapping out the bando
Pulled up to the condo, to the mansion, to the penthouse
Ain't got nowhere to trap no more
Plugged in with Obama, trapping out of the White House
Riding with J Tony
Guaranteed to knock lights out

[Hook: Quavo]

Fuck on your bitch
She lovin' the clique, I play with the clit (Play with it)
She pick up the bag, I make her go to work, and pay her in dick
My cars are tint (Tinted)
Put the stars in vics
No flaws, cars fit in my garage, about to m'nage a bitch
I got her number, got head from her, then I'm never gon' call the bitch
Double R ghost with the stars in the ceiling, foot out the window with the wrist, fuck 'em up
No need to talk, they know what it is
Don't fuck with the kid
I pull up and shoot at your wig and your kids
You fuck with the pigs

Park the Bentley on the curb
Diamonds came out the earth
Her pussy water when I'm kickin'
Her pussy water wanna surf
Auntie got a pack of percs
Put a nigga on a shirt
He pulled up, and he hopped out
But I had to shoot the nigga first
Took a bitch from the bottom
Name a pack, I done bought 'em
I met the plug at Ramada
Put the packs in the columns
Mac and cheese no collards
Big mac, no whopper
Macintosh no Apple
Mac 11 for the hackers

Hop out the robotic, this how I go 'bout it
Migos pulled up with Dracos I don't low ride 'em
Yeah he ya man but the stick 'bout to hole wide 'em
Stick to the code, who got shot, I don't know 'bout it
Who, huh we sellin' bombs, Saddam
I smell more millions to come
We spend a hundred for fun

Money, money, power, respect, I guess I'm addicted
Money, power, ammunition, guess I'm addicted

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Quavo!
Whoa, Addicted to the money, man
Ugh! Touch down on the plug for a hundred bands
Make the work flip like its gymnastics
Cartwheel or a handstand
They calling my spatula acrobat
I'm turning a brick to a platinum plaque
You put too much dope on that fishscale
My pockets is deeper than water wells
Plug on the border, got ships on the water
They stuffing the bricks in Beluga Whales
Young nigga just Giuseppe walkin'
House in Miami I'm kicking shit with the Dolphins
You hard on the web call him Peter Parker
Stuffed crust smoking Nikki Parker (Gas)
Gone!

Bando no cable (bando no cable?)
Travelling country to country
Skipping a stable, I'm whippin Mrs. Mabel

Money we makin, without a major
Ain't signing a contract and selling my soul
Cuz everything glitter ain't gold (it ain't)
Double D told me dont fold
The water so cold your partner gon' turn to a four
Dont trap on the block if you dont belong
Straps in my jeans but I ain't talkin' Girbauds
Box of cocaine on a tractor trailer
Sippin on Activis call me the activator
Terminate you like the Terminator
We at the top of the mountain no elevator
Money, pounds, and ammunition
Me, Flip, and LongWay in the kitchen
The labels they made us ridiculous
Cuz QC we independent

Keep god in your prayers
Just a millionaire in that sports coupe you lookin at
Gadgets on the Aston stoppin traffic I'm a space cadet
Came from nothin, took a lot of shit
Die by my respect
Ammunition, we got plenty
FNn's, Ak's and fifties
Baby chopper, clip longer than a toddler
I never been a lame, never had a bitch called me Rodger

Young nigga, I'm rich, I got MnMs
Ain't making no noise, I ain't heard of him
Your bitch wanna fuck cuz she see the diamonds
Stevie wonder, my VV's, I know they blinding
Hundred chains on my neck look like Busta Rhymes
I got out of jail to a goldmine
For you niggas that bustin my choppa gon bust
And gon hit em, gon flip em, gon make a concussion
Offset a Migo, my plug is amigo
He sendin me kilos, I fuck with Carlito
The pounds, them ounces, them grams
I'm selling the molly santan?
Brokanese niggas I dont understand
Karate chop a brick like I'm in Japan
Wrappin a brick in Saran


Yo
I wanna take a minute to say Rest In Peace to all the OGs man
You know a young nigga learned from that shit
Anybody that lost somebody man this for you
Takeoff turn up

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean! Lean!)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C (Damn!)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit!)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (Damn man!)
Two cups filled up with Easter pink (That lean lean!)
Take a minute, R.I.P, to PIMP C (Pimp C!)

Two cups filled up with actavis
Damn! rest in peace, to PIMP C
Louis V all over me I'm living luxury
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee
I remember the last time when Double talked to me (What Double say?)
Told me y'all the hottest niggas in the street
He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency
So I go buy a pint of lean
I'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean! Lean!)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C (Damn!)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit!)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (Damn man!)
Two cups filled up with Easter pink (That lean lean!)

Take a minute, R.I.P, OG Dee (Og Dee!)

Lost my daddy, young nigga I was only four (My daddy died!)
Damn! now I gotta pour a four
Got my momma on my back, she really love me though
Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door
I understand I have committed a sin
Double Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle
Never know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some disciples, gone!

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean! Lean!)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C (Damn!)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit!)

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

Free my nigga Westside, locked up to this day
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
I got a hoe and she got a hoe and now they both kissin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
Used to cook up bricks 'til I turned that shit to an extra now
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty, my nigga got 15, free Ronny
Check out my bio, plenty felonies, known for countin' up broccoli
Known for stackin' up celery, you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
Never selfish, all the money I gave
Never change, all the money I make
1 baby, all these bitches I laid
2 guns, nigga, never afraid
Migos the army I'm never gon' trade
Set-Set hit a 20 band juug
He helped the hood, everybody was good
I'm white like a tiger and I got the wood
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out
This shit is crazy, shout out mama house
Don't come to my trap and you unannounced
21 Challenger mounted up
Doin' phones, fucked your credit up
When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home
19, I was on my own
My grandma died, cancer on her bones
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

13 I got my first halftime
14, broke in the club for an Alpine
15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point
A lot of squads start poppin' up
Screamin' shit that we ain't heard of
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, "it wasn't us, bruh"
We know you flexin', got the information
So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'
Now we runnin' from the task force
Niggas was kickin' in doors, takin' flat screens and all the gold
Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
Knock in your door, take your lil' brother's Xbox
Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
Bout to fire up at the park right on Harrington
To the bando, you see niggas gamblin'
Hit a kick door my niggas be ramblin'
I got a bag on my back like I'm Santa Claus
Finnesse a nigga, Papa John's up in Panama

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

Young nigga, young nigga I'll rather be richer

Call up the plug no Santa, but he sending trees of gas for Christmas
Whippin' the dope, I terminate it, J's they say it's delicious
I got a bitch in my kitchen, with a onion booty I call her Deelishis
And after she water whip it, I make that bitch wash the dishes
Enter the Fisker, I'm doing 250, I'm praying I don't get a ticket
Yes I'm a Migo, but I don't wear Dickies, I'll rather put on True Religion
And if you want fame over money my nigga, then you not true to your religion

M's nigga, want them M's nigga
Got some niggas in the hood, they got M's nigga
Ask P, ask me
Northside Migo gang OG
Ridin' round, deuces on a damn Audi
Before I had a deal, young nigga copped it
Them dubs, them fifties, them hundreds, my trap always bunkin' you niggas is funny
I'm laughin with money, beatin the pot like I'm Sonny
Taking them trips making them flip
12 hit the block then I dip
Callin' up P, for the whips
Get in the pot then I whip!

[Hook: Takeoff]

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug's package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it's a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it's magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it's magically

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I'm facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I'm thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I'm thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn't trace it
It's a mystery, can't even solve the case
Don't be that nigga put on a plate

Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I'm in the kitchen whipping, it's a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I'm the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I'm pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I'm Stanley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley

[Hook: Quavo]
I took his bitch, he mad at me

Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it's a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it's magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it's magically

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I'm in the kitchen whipping, it's a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I'm the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I'm pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I'm Stanley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley

[Hook: Quavo]
I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug's package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I'm facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I'm thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

[Verse 2: Offset]
Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I'm thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn't trace it
It's a mystery, can't even solve the case
Don't be that nigga put on a plate

[Hook: Quavo]

Pull in a Maybach in the president a nigga riding with the curtains

(Pussy nigga ain't learn, thirty shots to that [?]
So surprised when they heard hit yellow tape the block when I curve it
Yellow taped the block when they curved it

Pull up on you, you in LA
If your not talking money for, what you say
Hit a nigga with the throwaway
When I step out bed I hop out with K's
I catch a nigga postin' in the city
When I throw the alley, ooh they gonna get it
Your is bitch too friendly, I know she with it
When I pull up on her put it in her kitty
Played that bit like I was Steve Nash
Since a young nigga I was chasing cash
Prescription lean came from Dr Phil
Hit a nigga in a crowd, Jermaine O'neal

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been on the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take that pot and fucking beat it
You never been on the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y'all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then lived in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty juice
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It's a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I'm John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got the nose on they guns, that go about it
Ain't no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don't weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Gas off in the back of the Sprinter bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touchin' butts
This is the life of the Hefty bags
You know that them ounces don't weigh enough

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been on the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take that pot and fucking beat it
You never been on the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y'all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then lived in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty juice
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

I came a long way from dropping a visit
Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finley
I trap out the bando, don't trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget
I keep the Mac like a midget
Mama we made us a milli, we did it
Fuck the negativity, fuck the critics

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it

Trap money, me and my dogs spend it

They hate that we came from the Northside
Then lived in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty juice
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

They hate that that money start coming in
And I be too fresh, I call it double mints
I was on the block, you was on punishment
Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliments
QC my label, and that's my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Puffin' the martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines
Now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn't a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I'm the author
These bitches be choosing, they digging my posture
Whipping babies, I'm not talking bout toddlers
Similac on these baby ballers
Little babies get stuck they call me stepfather

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been on the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take that pot and fucking beat it
You never been on the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y'all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then lived in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty juice
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

Early in the morning eat leftovers

I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand silent, never let another nigga take it from you

It was a struggle, grandma dead man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a [?] said I wasn't going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the set then my niggas cannot call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kick in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that's the number one goal
If a nigga want a problem then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain't nobody new to it

And that's the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle

Wanna take her to my room, take her
Can I take you to my room?
I got a big house, I live in a mansion
I got a lake you can canoe
Every time she see the jewels
She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dab in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap hound
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She act just like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, suprise on your birthday
Got you the H3 Hummer
Now we on the phone and she on the road
She gonna go get the blue bundle
I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her
Man, she look like Kimora, look like Kimora
Wanna ride like Sequoia

Hey girl, look at you

Austin Powers, baby groove
Take you to Montreal, Canada
Let you dive off in my 50 feet pool
All y'all vehicles old
Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you
No offense to you, but I ain't spendin' my money on you
She said "nooooo, baby don't go"
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994

[Hook: Quavo]

Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I Dream of Jeannie
Phantom pulling up, after that Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor
I do not trust her, she suckin' the plastic
I beat it, I killed it, put it in a casket
She the talk of the trenchez, they know that she nasty
Know that she ratchet and she is not classy
I'm cool on her
I'll send her right back, give me this girl
You can have your ho

Pull up and I got the juice (I got the juice)

My momma she told me I made it, Im tired of my family slavin
Daddy was a hospital patient, next thing you know he couldn't make it
I put my head down I ain't cry, cuz then I ain't know what death mean
Then a when a nigga growed up I ain't have my daddy on the scene
So a nigga had to lend to his momma, So a nigga had to go chase commas
Use to eat dollar menu at mcdonalds, now I'm eating big plates at
Benihanas, gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Que]
Its first thang I do when I wake up
I'm thanking the lord stay prayed up
Its hard out here for a young nigga
If you ain't got heart you get ate up
Just tryin to maintain and stay out that cell without breakin the law
But its hard as hell, the man above for showing me love
Im taking them trips to Beverly Hills, runnin through hoes
And counting them M's, living life high like Invader Zim
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money
G's on my specs, I sin everday just to get this success
I want it for me, yall want it to flex
The difference between us its clear as it gets
Niggas be fake so I show no respect

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I don't know why the lord save me
All the time I disobey him
You would think I would be in dem cages
So every day I wake and thank him
From kickin dem doors sellin them babies
To walkin through Jeff for a price of a baby
I swear its a blessing I never regret it
This shit gets so hectic a nigga start stressing
The kush ain't helpin', lookin' at my Smith 
&
Wesson
Looking for them vegetarians I'm taking yo lettuce and celery
I'm posted on sunset in Beverly Hills my niggas they do this for real
I'm drinking the Act out the seal got niggas waiting for they appeal

Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?
Gotta make a difference in your own hood
Feel like Will Smith, I see millions, I'm gonna pursue it
If my momma told me if I came up short it's all good
No I had to tell my mom sorry, I could picture me in that 'Rari
After all the pain that we went through
I don't even wanna rewind it
Free all my niggas went down in the system
Send the Green Dot cause I miss 'em
R.I.P. my nigga Pistol, can't believe the bullet hit him
Sometimes a young nigga might wanna cry
But I can't let you niggas see it
It was in my soul takin' flats and gold
Juugin' round the city for no reason
Juug Season, that's what a young nigga called it, Juug Season
In the jungle, I survived every season

[Hook: Quavo]
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?

[Verse 2: Offset]
What are you doin'? You had money, you blew it
You had dreams on the court, didn't have no support
All these niggas they stuck in the system
Police keep killin' my people
Trap on the block with the reefer
Tryin' to count up the monifa
Beating the pot I might sneak her
Used to kick doors for new sneakers
Can't trust no bitch cause the sneakin'
I step out that, shoot through your back call you Ricky
Now I got riches so bitches they miss me
Wanna know what you been doin' all this time
Why you ain't got no money on your mind
Together we stand, we fall apart then we divide
Fuck the police we might start up a riot
This shit is so pitiful, had to pay money for my nigga's funeral
That was my nigga we had so much unity
I got in my heart, he on top and he smilin'
Used to talk about a fuckin' rivalry
What about police that take a bribery?
They don't give a fuck about people in poverty
Don't got no property
This a democracy, no apology

[Hook: Quavo]
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?

Most of my niggas kick doors right now
Run up on a nigga tryna rob, got a 100 round drum right now
Most of my niggas court, judge don't drop the hammer down
No Tony Parker, I came a long way from that starter
I'm thanking God cause I never had to ride that Marta
Now my diamonds flawless, make a nigga nauseous
That nigga fresher than Carlton, tryna fuck on Ms. Parker
Remember wanna be a monster, niggas playin' cops and robbers
Ever since a youngin' I was a problem

You niggas bitches, you niggas be gossiping'

Performin' on stage, no safety on the pistol
Lil' mama whispering niggas plottin' in the V.I.P

Gotta know she real bad, I leave the club, I miss her
Bounce that ass ho, boing boing, pogo
Throw the profit on lil mama, cuz she make me more

You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it
Ain't got time for a kid, the lil' bitch at the front door

You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

These hoes wishy washy
Ain't no doubt about it
Quick to put your finger in a young nigga's wallet
And I know you fuckin' my partner
Quick to fuck a nigga for a couple hunna
High class pimpin' these niggas, she got the formula
Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom
Wishy washy
Cut these bitches off like hibachi
I'm fuckin' her and her whole posse
If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing
Up to par, my swag from London
These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'
I'm just sayin', I can see your plan
You wanna get married to a rich man

You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs

Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

I can't fuck with you bitches, you wishy washy
Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten
But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans
She watchin' me like I'm on demand
She the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)

You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

Diamonds, gold, neck, woah

Pipe up this bitch
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch
Make it dark in this bitch
Don't worry 'cause I got some light on my wrist
Want to talk about dabbin'
The difference between us and them, we created that shit
Stackin' money ever since
If it ain't about money, then it don't make sense
Dope in the troop and it's two percent tint
Dope in the coochie, young pimp in this bitch
Keep it 100, I'm sick of this bitch
Never ate breakfast but eat up the grits
Hold that bitch down but she can't get the stick
Taking a trip, I'ma give her the dick
Chew it up, eat it up like it's a Twix
Most of these niggas not, they counterfeit
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I'm gonna have to charge you a ten
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Fell asleep on drank at the house party with Diddy
Who the fuck said we ain't plugged in the city
Never mind, niggas done turned into crickets (Takeoff!)

Big, body, Benz, damn

Pistols, hammers, AKs, bananas
Dirty, Diana, on molly, dandruff
This my propaganda, riding 'round Atlanta
I see a hundred cameras, doing shows in Alabama
I'm not your average rapper
Come to my trap, I'll tax ya
My diamonds came from Africa, like Michael Blackson
I spent 10k in Magic, two bitches fucked my fashion
They think because I'm rapping, Houdini won't do magic
Working the water, Atlantic
Money stretched out to Kansas
Big body panoramic
I told your bitch to get the dancer
Shoot a nigga, hit the canvas
Get off my grass like I'm Stanley
I'm higher than a chimpanzee
Ranked number one, my standings

Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, woah

Look at my diamonds, they wink and say peek-a-boo
I shock the block like I'm Pikachu
I shot the Glock, tried to kill a few
I put that dope in her dookie chute
We fuck these bitches, we switch-a-roo
I had to beat it like Michael do
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce
I create flames when I'm in the booth
Wide, body, I'm bout to buy me an island
Dab, stylish, these not on the shelf, you can't find 'em
Ice, blind 'em, if I'm eyeing it told you I'm buying it
We together, we never divided
Like a feather I'm flier than pilots
Chew my dab up just like it is Trident
Kept it real with you niggas, we tried it
Got to hit hard and move silent
If it's bout the money then I'm riding
If you broke, need a job, I can hire you
Offset, your dab is expiring
Your pockets ain't straight, need alignment
The bando is my type of environment, bando!

Your ho wanna fuck, I don't want her
Popped a perc and I'm geeked in Aroma
You rented it, I'm the owner
Took your ho cause she gave me a boner

You can really smell me 'fore I'm coming
Cause Quavo got a whole onion

You say you got checks and they bouncing

I'm having bricks in all of my houses
I make a public announcement
I'm getting money while you niggas lousy
Shoot a nigga with a rocket like Lowry
Wipe a nigga's nose like I use Bounty
Quicker picker upper, you a sucker
Cut his body up then drop it in the bowl (cut it)
I got a white ho speaking Russian
Sad to say you niggas drinking 'Tussin
Give me my dab, I'm taking custody
Hop out the Lam and start bustin'
You want your ho back but she stuck to me
RIP Mike and Pistol Pete
New to you, but it's old to me
Walking in flames, I can't see my feet
All of you niggas want to be like me
The radio sounding like mini-me's
Take a knee, you need to honor me

I put that bitch on the pork, she can't get enough
Got these bitches playing double dutch
Put that dick in her mouth, tell her pucker up
Catch you biting the dab, you get sucker punched
After I fuck that bitch once, then punt

They say I ain't give 'em none'
I gave these niggas the flow that they using

I made a play out in Athens
I'm whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu'fuckers say
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don't get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon' run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon' flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That's the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Chopping my top, get your top out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn't have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Some niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain't talking 'bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin' and havin'
My niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally (so that's a 60)
I would give you names of these Migos clones but it's every rapper in the industry
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don't let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas'll envy me
Behind the lot shootin' at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn't know
People compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they'll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it's inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin's
(hot, hot), the block is sizzling
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told 'em north side wasn't the trenches?
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain't my fault, nigga, it's your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
I bought twenty pints of Activis
You think I'm sellin' em, but that's just for me to sip it
If you don't believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin's
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me's
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch' knees week
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it's up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I'm that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy 'cause they know that I'm a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon' feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on Margiela one day, then Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don't care 'bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don't fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I'm not being friendly, I don't want to kick it
Didn't write no letter, you niggas ain't visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can't fuck with us period
I see a million when I'm in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my leer
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don't get indicted


She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty

She make it feel good when I'm wasted
I don't know nothin' but automatics
Niggas run up on you let you have it
Chopper hit 'em brrt, static

And you made me cop weed from me
Five dollars, what you need from me?
Gave it to you 'cause you need it, homie
Now I'm chillin' at the afterparty
And I'm here, now you have to party
Now you dead, nigga now you sorry
You can stay here but just keep it quiet
'Cause my niggas they come alive

But I spin your block with like five guys

I wake up in the morning, she put brain on me
She put brain on me
I don't trust no fuck niggas
Like the Indian's, you get slumped niggas
By the muzzles nigga
Leave your body in the dump with it
Don't fuck with it
When I touch a mil, have fun with it
But I'm too thin, grind and get it
Middle fingers up to my competition
I'm on a mission so I'm sneak dissin'
Hate on me cause a nigga different
Nice whips, I got some foreign bitches
Smokin' gas without a hit
Then this bitch got me thinkin'
About all the niggas she fuckin' with
They ain't getting money so fuck the bitch
She could suck my dick on some other shit
And I'm L.O.D. gonna be hella rich
I cook up this wood like a bakery

Billboard's a jungle gym
Sat back and watch 'em climb 'em

Crab roll starters (no chopsticks)

[Intro: Desiigner]
Get out my way
Fuck nigga talk, get the fuck out my face
Chopper been loaded, the drum in our way
Drum on the K

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
I'm not letting no nigga g-get in my way
Fuck nigga talk, he get hit with the K
The chopper been loaded, the drum on the K
Thought I went crazy, but back in my way
You could get hit up, just watch what you say
Don't fuck with the 12, but got 12 in the gauge
Niggas getting hit up, bodies getting zipped up
Niggas start feelin' a couple of ways
Damian Lillard, blaze
Smoking on dope, haze
Flex on the bitch, Johnny Cage
Got infrared beam on the stage
The coco, the chronic, cocaine
Feelin' like I'm Lil Wayne
Lot of codeine, hid it from the from the gang
Hit it, hit it, hey
Chill in the trap for the winter
Pockets full of that dead nigga
Niggas be talking that wigga
I'ma keep stackin' my jigga
Lot of killers in the West
Young nigga tryna get up
Pick up, fall, get up
Pussy, fall get up
And I got bad bitch, she with me
Twisting my weed and she rolling my swisher
I got her mom in the kitchen
Bout to go in the back room with her sister
I'm the man, I'm the nigga
Niggas didn't know I'm that nigga
Some niggas not them real niggas
Got to watch out for them niggas

[Hook: Desiigner]
Zombiie walk, no control
Lotta chopper, let it blow
Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk

Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk

[Verse 2: King Savage]
I'm just smoking on dope and it's fucking my brains
I'm sipping on Henny, it got me enraged
I'm riding 'round town in them Rari's and Range
Your bitch on my dick and she giving me play
Savage nigga, like to play with them things
He got a big missile, and he aiming for brains
I don't trust niggas, all them niggas fugazi
I don't shop on a budget, I'm just getting the cake
My niggas fucked up the cake
They do anything, they switching them lanes
I stay with Scottie Pippen
Leave your body limpin' when I find that you fucked with the Jakes
Pass me the K, bullets put face on the pave
Chopper put niggas in graves
Bullets put face on the pave
Chopper put niggas in graves
I'm sipping on Actavis
I call that doctor-drink
Nick Cannon, got the drum
I think that that the beat
I keep that thing on me
No you can't hang with me
The chopper go bang with me
Them niggas can't hang with me
